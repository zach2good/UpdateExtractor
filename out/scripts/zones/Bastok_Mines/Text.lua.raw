6774 : Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle. We charge a service fee of # Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of. My records indicate that you currently have # Allied Notes.
6775 : Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes. Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.
6776 : I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with %. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?
6777 : (DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!
6778 : Welcome, Master! This is your home, the Mog House, kupo!
6779 : I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!
6780 : I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!
6781 : First, the basics, kupo! Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to Mog House when you're in your Mog House, kupo!
6782 : Press it and the Mog House menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!
6783 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
6784 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
6785 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
6786 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
6787 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
6788 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
6789 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
6790 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
6791 : If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
6792 : You can send items and gil to your friends with the Send command, kupo!
6793 : (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
6794 : Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
6795 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
6796 : And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
6797 : All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
6798 : As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
6799 : This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
6800 : It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
6801 : If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
6802 : Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the Layout command, kupo!
6803 : It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo! Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!

6805 : You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!
6806 : Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?
6807 : Are you sure? I'm sure! Maybe I'm not so sure...
6808 : And finally, a little bit of advice!
6809 : If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
6810 : If you type /ae Hello!, then your message will be heard by many people.
6811 : If you type /ae followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
6812 : Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
6813 : Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
6814 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
6815 : Ask about your Mog House again? Don't ask. Ask.
6816 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
6817 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
6818 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
6819 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
6820 : Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
6821 : I found this precious item under the % pillow, kupo!
6822 : It's all yours, kupo!
6823 : I used the % to write a song for you, kupo!
6824 : Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!
6825 : I found this item in the back of one of the %'s drawers, kupo!
6826 : It's all yours, kupo!
6827 : I found this in the back of the %, kupo!

6830 : Luck is on your side, kupo! Take it, kupo!
6831 : I fished this item out of the %, kupo!
6832 : It was very hard work, kupo... I'm very tired, kupo...
6833 : I found this behind the % painting, kupo!
6834 : This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6835 : Something clattered inside the % when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
6836 : It's all yours, kupo!
6837 : I felt there was something strange about the %, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
6838 : We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6839 : Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
6840 : At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
6841 : For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
6842 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
6843 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
6844 : Each item of furniture you place using the Layout command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
6845 : When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!

6851 : I found % inside the %, kupo!
6852 : Kupo...? I sense that this % is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!

6854 : It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
6855 : Look what I found in your %!

6861 : It must be a present from the smilebringers. Here, you should have it, kupo!
6862 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.
6863 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
6864 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
6865 : Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
6866 : We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
6867 : Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
6868 : Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!
6869 : We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...
6870 : Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
6871 : Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your %, when this % just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!
6872 : Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious? It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6873 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6874 : Look at what I found while cleaning out the %: %!
6875 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6877 : It all began with a raindrop,      or so the legend says...
6878 : Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
6879 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
6880 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
6881 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
6882 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
6883 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
6884 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
6885 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
6886 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
6887 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
6888 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
6889 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
6890 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
6891 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
6892 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
6893 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...
6894 : Do something? Read instructions. Change parameters. Teleport to key locations. Warp to home point. Receive items. Obtain 100,000,000 gil. Do nothing.
6895 : Hail, adventurer! I am the most mighty of moogles, my miraculous magicks able to alter all manner of arcane attributes!
6896 : But be forewarned, kupo! Once modified by moogle magick, your parameters cannot be restored to their prior state!

7010 : You may teleport between these crystalline nodes called home points for efficient travel. Be sure to examine any you stumble upon.
7011 : There's some special crystal nodes known as home points that'll undoubtedly serve you well. Don't forget to interact with all that you find, as they can help you get to far away places.

7054 : If you want to know where Arva is, open the Map menu, choose Markers, and press the right arrow key. She should be somewhere in that list.

7069 : Hello, [sir/ma'am]. I have been appointed by the Guildworkers' Union to manage the trading of manufactured crafts and the exchange of guild points.
7070 : However, to assure product quality, I cannot carry out any business with those who rank lower than novice.
7071 : I see that you currently have a trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild. I'm sorry, but I cannot do any business with you.
7072 : You do have the option to terminate your contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and form one with us.
7073 : After signing a new contract, you will have to wait until the next delivery phase to trade Guildworkers' Union requested items.
7074 : Create a new contract with us? Immediately. Not today.
7075 : Are you certain? I said, Immediately. On second thought...
7076 : You have terminated your trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and formed a new one with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7077 : Our system works like this. We will ask you to provide us with a certain item depending on your craft skill rank. There is a set time limit (one day, Earth time) in which you may bring as many of the item as you can synthesize.
7078 : If you happen to create a high quality version of the requested item, we will be more than delighted to accept that as well.
7079 : Trading us these items will earn you guild points which can be later exchanged for other specialty goods--some of which are found exclusively at this guild.
7080 : The amount of guild points you will receive varies with the item requested, and there is a limit to how many points you can accumulate during the designated time frame. Trading items after you have reached the limit will result in no points gained.
7081 : When the time limit has expired, the item requested by the guild will change. It will also change in the event your craft skill rises.
7082 : I see that you have not formed a trading contract with any of the other guilds.
7083 : If you wish, you may form a new contract with us. However, if you wish to trade items with another guild, you must first terminate your existing contract and forfeit all the guild points you have accumulated.
7084 : You have formed a new trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.

7086 : Currently, no items are being requested by the guild. You have # guild points accumulated.
7087 : Is there something you need? I'm just passing through. I would like to use my points. What are the current limits? How does the trade system work?
7088 : You have # more days (Vana'diel time) to provide us with the requested item.
7089 : Today (Vana'diel time) is the final day we will accept the requested item.

7091 : You are not eligible to receive guild points at this time.

7113 : You have successfully renounced your status as a [craftsman/artisan/adept] of the [Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7114 : And you are? This is the Alchemists' Guild. In other words, an organization that researches the origins of the universe, and puts that knowledge to use in the development of new medicines and items.
7115 : Oh, you must be looking for the shop. It's down the stairs, on your right.
7116 : Well, well, well. An adventurer. Then we shall start you with crystal synthesis.
7117 : You must already know, but crystals house different forms of energy. Crystal synthesis taps that energy and utilizes it to transform matter.
7118 : The success of crystal synthesis depends on the images of the product made by the user. In other words, the better the user, the better the image, the better the final product.
7119 : Obviously, the more experience you accumulate over the years, the more skilled you will become.
7120 : If there is anything you don't understand, ask the alchemists here in this guild. You are now one of their companions!
7121 : To master alchemy is to know the universe. And to know the universe requires time.
7122 : Along with the mastery of alchemy, you have obtained the knowledge of the universe. However, knowing the universe means having the power to destroy it. Such power is not to be trifled with.
7123 : I sense that you have attained enough knowledge to move on to the next plane of alchemy.
7124 : Make % and I will further entrust you with the secrets of the universe.
7125 : ... This work seems to be flawless. I hereby entrust you with the title of [amateur/recruit/initiate/novice/apprentice]. I look forward to you seeing your future work.

7127 : Wonderful! I am proud to have you stand by my side as an artisan.
7128 : The day has finally come. You are now worthy to be called an adept alchemist. Let us, together, reap the benefits of the vast knowledge of the universe.
7129 : Would ya speak up, [sonny/missy]? I can't hear ya with all that racket.
7130 : I've already helped ya. Try learning some respect for your elders, [sonny/missy].

7136 : If you have not yet realized, we have our own work as well.
7137 : This is not enough, and I am not in the mood for bargaining.
7138 : Hopefully this will not take too long. Are you ready?
7139 : If it means I can get back to my work, jot down this data on % and leave me be.
7140 : There. Now be off with you. I must be getting back to my experiments.
7141 : Are you still here, darling? This is a sanctuary of wisdom. I have no time to sit around and eat crumpets with the ignorant, unwashed masses.
7142 : I can fully understand why you'd want to bask in the iridescent glow of my unfathomably astounding intelligence, but as you know, there is only so much I can do for those like...you.
7143 : A, ha ha. Darling, I have no time to be performing good deeds for mere peasants.
7144 : Take a deep breath and relax. Close your eyes and let Sieglinde do the rest...
7145 : Well, I suppose even someone like you could manage %. You will need...
7146 : Come back and visit Sieglinde if you ever need anything!
7147 : People have begun talking of your work. Their words have even made it all the way to the halls of this guild. You are ready for your next test. Create %.
7148 : Pass, and you will be accepted as a craftsman...and then I will show you the true power that the universe hides.
7149 : However, you must take care. Bearing the name of craftsman means you must clear your mind of all stray thoughts, and focus on the task before you. Why you ask?
7150 : In alchemy, losing your focus could result in a tragedy of universal proportions. This is why we advise against becoming a craftsman in more than one guild.
7151 : A perfect job...as always, I might add. I hereby bestow you with the honorary title of veteran. I would not be suprised if you have attained the skills to turn mere lead into gold!
7152 : Excellent work. I have no difficulty in bestowing upon you...the title of craftsman.
7153 : I apologize for being redundant, but remember, you must focus. Clear your mind of needless rubble, and open your eyes to the secrets the universe holds.
7154 : % is a forbidden type of alchemy that is used to drain elemental energy from remnants of lost memories, and transform it into a partially materialized quasispirit known as anima.
7155 : I have received word that you have accepted the title of craftsman from another guild. Tell me, %, did I not advise against this course of action?
7156 : Your blatant disregard of my warning does not please me...
7157 : However, I offer you the opportunity to redeem yourself of your errant past. Revoke your craftsman status from all other guilds and you will be forgiven.
7158 : Revoke all other craftsman statuses? Yes. I apologize for my behavior. No. I have made up my mind.
7159 : Spoken like a true alchemist. I see a bright future for you, %. I will inform the other guildmasters of your decision later. You may return to your research now.
7160 : Perhaps I was wrong... Perhaps there are things in this world more important than the study of alchemy... Perhaps...
7161 : % is a wonderful new method of alchemy that allows you to enchant various items and catalysts with the mysterious energy of black magic and anima.
7162 : % is a wonderful new method of alchemy that allows you to enchant various items and catalysts with the mysterious energy of white magic and anima.
7163 : I am sorry, darling, but the items from that rank are simply beyond you at this point.
7164 : % is a wonderful new method of alchemy that allows you to place ingredients in a triturator, making it easier to process more medicines with one crystal.
7165 : % is a wonderful new method of alchemy that allows you to concentrate ingredients to create medicines in the form of a solid drop. These drops have the same effect as their liquid equivalents.
7166 : Our young Abd-al-Raziq has ordered in a pile of research journals from his homeland. There're alchemical processes in there that even I've never seen.
7167 : Maybe you can teach an old bird new tricks! Heh-heh-heh <Cough!> <Cough!> heh...
7168 : % is a wonderful new method of alchemy that allows you to utilize the techniques of chemical medicine.
7169 : You want to make %? In case you didn't already know, a volatile objectaru like that needs to be kept in a special container.
7170 : Such a container can be synthesized if you have two % and %. And if my memory serves me true, % serves as the bonding agentaru.
7171 : %, I hear, can be had within the Maze of Shakhrami. Not lying scattered about the floors, obviously. One of the crawlers there might be willing to partaru with one, but if not...well, you adventuring types know what to do.
7172 : Oh, did I mention %? Naturally, to synthesize %, you'll be needing one of those, too.
7173 : You wish to synthesize %? Ah, yes. Well do I know that recipe! Its creation requires a few %.
7174 : In turn, making % requires % and %. Toss % into the mix, and what you seek shall be yours.
7175 : I fear we haven't % here. But it should please you to know that skeletons dwelling within the Gusgen Mines are known to drop one on occasion.
7176 : What brings you here? Well, %, of all things... You couldn't hope to make one without some %, but I fear they aren't often stocked by vendors.
7177 : But you strike me as an intrepid type, so I'll share with you some knowledge to help you on your way. Head over to Ordelle's Caves. Hunt enough bats there, and you might just come into some %. That's the main ingredient required to make %.
7178 : All that remains, then, is to bind it with % using %. Good luck!
7179 : You... Yes, the description fits. I daresay, you're the one she sent, yes?
7180 : Can I count on you to aid my investigation once more?
7181 : At my client's behest, I have procured the item you require. But alas, doing so drained far more of my time and resources than had been reckoned. As recompense for having exerted undue effort, I would ask a favor of you. Do as I say, and you may consider the item yours.
7182 : Do as he says? Yes. No.
7183 : Very good. I knew I could count on us being on the same page.  Now then, without further ado, I shall explain the task to you. It truly is simple.
7184 : You are to investigate a number of creatures dwelling within the Sea Serpent Grotto in my stead.
7185 : Should you not possess % and %, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.
7186 : Using the % will turn % into %--a visual record of the subject's physical characteristics.
7187 : I'm currently investigating the %, the %, and the %.
7188 : Hm? It appears you are overburdened. Speak with me again after you've reorganized your belongings.
7189 : That is most disappointing... She would not be pleased to hear of this.
7190 : Ah, yes...
7191 : A truly menacing image of the %! All that remains, then, is one each of the % and the %.
7192 : Do you require % and %? I can provide you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.
7193 : Buy for 800 gil? (You have #) Yes, please. No, thank you.
7194 : Should you not possess % and %, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee. I've recently depleted my stores, however, so you will have to wait until the next shipment arrives.
7195 : It appears you haven't enough gil.
7196 : Ah, a positively imposing image of the %! All that remains, then, is one of the %.
7197 : I've eagerly awaited your return. With this image of the %, I hold your task fulfilled.
7198 : As promised, I relinquish this to you. Should another be required, you shall find me here.
7199 : I need images of the %, the %, and the %.
7200 : You've yet to bring me images of the % and the %.
7201 : You've yet to bring me an image of the %.
7202 : A fine image this is, but this creature isn't one of my investigation subjects.
7203 : I fear I haven't the time to trade pleasantries with random strangers. Please leave me be.
7204 : Is there something else you wish of me? You already have what you came for, no?
7205 : We don't know what you're doing here, but truth be told, we're not really interested.
7206 : Putting up a fight, eh? Gorattz! Bompupu! Show [him/her] what the Tenshodo thinks of meddlesome adventurers!
7207 : D-damn... I'm in way over my head...
7208 : Ugh... [He/She]'s tougher than [he/she] looks...
7209 : Waaah! I didn't signy-wign up for this...
7210 : [Renfred/Gorattz/Bompupu]'s shadow image disappears...
7211 : The [Skeleton Scuffler/Blest Bones/Holey Horror/Steely Weapon/Lode Golem/Fired Urn] fades away into nothingness...
7212 : The power of the Great Star Tree has been released!
7213 : We warmly welcome you to the place of your unmaking.
7214 : From your ground bones, a loaf of bread we shall be baking.
7215 : We shall curse you unto death! Prepare to breathe your final breath!
7216 : We will make you beg to die! Six fulms under you will lie!
7217 : Naughty children shall receive no quarter! Curl up and die, this is your empress's order!
7218 : You've long overstayed your welcome! The punishment will be brutal and gruesome!
7219 : Which way do you like it--slow or fast? Should you lose a limb, be not aghast!
7220 : You'll wish you were never born! From your torso limbs will be torn!
7221 : Steel yourself for a wicked fright!
7222 : We shall set your pants alight!
7223 : The world shall bow before our might!
7224 : H-how could this be? This outcome, we did not foresee...
7225 : Be this a dream? Or is it real? This ending falls sorely short of ideal...
7226 : 'Twas high time you were made to know that your abilities are purely for show. Ohohohohoho!
7227 : A fitting end for a talentless crew that tried to bite off more than it could chew. Ohohohohoho!
7228 : Your body absorbs the power held within the ancient runes!
7229 : You cannot enter this battlefield with % in your possession.
7230 : It appears you must wait longer to commence the battle.
7231 : You are not in possession of %. Unable to enter the battlefield for [Sugar-coated Directive/Battaru Royale/Project: Shantottofication].
7232 : You cannot enter the battlefield for [Sugar-coated Directive/Battaru Royale/Project: Shantottofication] with % in your possession.
7233 : The % has no effect. It appears you should come back later.
7234 : You are not in possession of a sap crystal. Unable to enter the battlefield for Battaru Royale.
7235 : The sap crystal has no effect. More time must elapse before you can enter the battlefield for Battaru Royale.
7236 : You are not in possession of a Tablet of Hexes. Unable to enter the battlefield for Project: Shantottofication.
7237 : The Tablet of Hexes has no effect. More time must elapse before you can enter the battlefield for Project: Shantottofication.
7238 : The door is sealed.
7239 : Your opponents deem you too weak to be worthwhile, disappearing whence they came.
7240 : The time has come, %. The time to move beyond your limits as [a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master] and seek the answers to yet deeper questions of our universe. I trust you are up to the task?
7241 : Up to the task? I am! I am not...
7242 : Yes, of course you are. Your answer was known to me long before I posed the question. Acquire yourself a copy of % from Hemewmew, and we shall proceed from there.
7243 : An alchemist of your caliber need not be told that nothing in our universe comes without a price, and that a nominal fee in guild points must be paid to obtain the tome.
7244 : All for the better. Pursuing alchemy with imperfect focus has been known to lead to madness, disaster...or worse. When you are prepared to devote the entirety of your soul to our practice, you may return. And not a day before.
7245 : Acquire yourself a copy of % from Hemewmew, and we shall proceed from there.
7246 : Say not a word, %. It is as plain as day to me. You have familiarized yourself with the contents of %.
7247 : Very well. Create for me %. This is what you will need. Listen well--the prospect of repeating myself does not amuse me.
7248 : And be sure to leave your name upon your work. Why, you say? I would think it obvious, but will leave the question for you to ponder.
7249 : Have the fumes gotten to your head? I've already told you that making % requires...
7250 : Yes, this shall do. You have taken one step closer to true knowledge, %. I bestow upon you the rank of expert. From this day on, let us unravel the mysteries of this universe together.
7251 : Is this some poor attempt at humor, %? No self-respecting alchemist would be so ignorant as to submit for review a work that did not bear their name.
7252 : Let it suffice to say that I am not entertained. Return to your laboratory and do not return without that which I asked you for.
7253 : People have begun talking of your work. Their words have even wafted all the way to the halls of this guild. You are ready for your next trial. Create for me %.
7254 : Pass, and you will be accepted as [an artisan/an adept/a veteran]...and then I will show you the true power that the universe hides.
7255 : However, you must take care. Bearing the name of [artisan/adept/veteran] means you must clear your mind of all stray thoughts, and focus on the task before you. Why, you ask?
7256 : In alchemy, losing your focus could result in a tragedy of universal proportions. This is why we advise against becoming [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in more than one guild.
7257 : Of all the disciplines, alchemy demands the highest degree of focus from its practitioners. Entertain even a moment's thought of striving for [artisan/adept/veteran] status in another guild, and true knowledge of the mysteries of the universe will forever elude you.
7258 : I have received word that you have accepted the title of [artisan/adept/veteran] from another guild. Tell me, %, did I not advise against this course of action?
7259 : Your blatant disregard of my warning does not please me...
7260 : However, I offer you the opportunity to redeem yourself of your errant past. Revoke your [artisan/adept/veteran] status from any lesser guild and you will be forgiven.
7261 : I will inform the other guildmasters of your decision, so that you may return immediately to your research. Do we have an agreement?
7262 : Perhaps I was wrong... Perhaps there are things in this world more important than the study of alchemy...
7263 : Could it be that it is not you who strays from the true path, but I? No! Such thoughts are madness! I must...not...waver...!
7264 : Greetings adventurer! I'm so glad you've come, kupo! To celebrate the safe recovery of all eleven of King Kupofried's mog tablets, we're offering a limited-time teleportation service for the low, low price of # gil! What do you say?
7265 : Teleport to where? (Cost: # gil.) Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst. Selbina. Mhaura.
7266 : Your wish is my command, kupo! For a small fee of # gil, that is...
7267 : Safe travels, kupo!
7268 : Looks like you're light on funds, kupo... Sorry!
7269 : What's this? You're still new to this land? I'm afraid you're not yet strong enough to handle our potent moogle magic! Just forget I said anything, kupo!
7270 : Oh, what a shame! The mog tablets have been scattered to the winds once more! Without their power, I'm afraid we can't help you, kupo.

7293 : The information on this page instructs you to defeat the following:
7294 : Scylds required: # (Balance: #) Elusiveness: [//////////] Ferocity: [//////////] Reward: # [scyld/scylds]
7295 : Accept hunt? (Current scylds: #) Yes. No.
7296 : Hunt accepted!
7297 : You use # [scyld/scylds]. Scyld balance: #.
7298 : You do not have enough scylds.
7299 : The hunt registry is a tome through which seasoned adventurers can undertake assignments to eliminate monsters deemed to be impediments to A.M.A.N. activities.
7300 : The hunt registry is a tome through which veteran soldiers can undertake assignments to eliminate monsters deemed to be impediments to S.M.A.N. activities.
7301 : Assignments, or hunts, can be undertaken simply by selecting the name of a monster listed in the registry.
7302 : Pertinent information such as monster elusiveness and ferocity has been recorded for your reference. As safety cannot be guaranteed, we ask that you hunt within your ability.
7303 : Hunts pit you against creatures of extreme ferocity, and are not intended for training. For this reason, you cannot undertake a hunt while a training regime is active.
7304 : Should party members undertaking a common hunt defeat the objective, the kill will be considered valid for all.
7305 : Upon the completion of a hunt, record your success in a hunt registry. Doing so will earn you rewards corresponding to difficulty as well as scylds--tokens of your valor.
7306 : More scylds will grant you access to increasingly difficult and rewarding assignments. Be warned, however, that once expended, scylds will not be refunded for any reason.
7307 : Lastly, please note that a mandatory cool-down period will be imposed upon all hunters following the completion of a hunt. Until this time has elapsed, you will not be permitted to undertake another hunt.

7310 : You obtain # [scyld/scylds]! Current balance: # [scyld/scylds].
7311 : The status of your current hunt is as follows.
7312 : Cancel hunt? Yes. No.
7313 : Are you certain? Yes. No.
7314 : Hunt canceled.

10388 : No, that won't work either. Confound it! If only there were a skilled synergist around here to help me out...
10389 : No, that won't work either. Confound it! If only I could find a--
10390 : Wait a minute...you there! Yes, you! That faint yet distinctive scent of fewell and ash...
10391 : Yes, there's no mistaking it. You're a synergist, aren't you?
10392 : Oh, lucky day! What say you assist me with the project I'm working on? I guarantee that it'll be worth your while.
10393 : Help Selliste? Not interested. My pleasure!
10394 : Hmph! Another synergist too preoccupied with [his/her] own oh-so-important research to share [his/her] knowledge with the common folk. But hey, I'm a patient woman. If you ever have a change of heart, I'll be here!
10395 : Wonderful! Who said that all synergists were snooty, good-for-nothing snobs? Not me, that's for sure!
10396 : Anyhow, allow me to explain. You may have noticed that these synergy furnaces are a tad unwieldy, to say the least.
10397 : Not much of a concern when you're synergizing here in the city, but hardly suited to the peripatetic life of an adventurer. That's when it hit me!
10398 : Surely you've read the histories. In the days of the Crystal War, there were those studious types who could make massive tomes appear and disappear out of thin air. What were they called again...? Bookheads? Eggworms?
10399 : But it's not their name that's important. No, it's the technique they used to store and summon their libraries! "Arcane snap" or something like that? Anyway!
10400 : So I figure, if only I could get my hands on some of the astral whatchamacallit that the egghead-types used to whip out their grim-whatsits, I could toss together a nifty gizmo that could work the same magic for these synergy thingamajigs!
10401 : I tell you, sometimes I amaze even myself with the clarity of my ideas!
10402 : But you look puzzled. Sorry, let's try that again in layman's terms.
10403 : I'm working on a totally amazing invention, and you're going to help me complete it!
10404 : All you need to do is use your synergy skills to whip up %, and I'll take care of the rest. Nothing could be easier! So, what do you say?
10405 : Help Selliste? Not interested. My pleasure!
10406 : Splendid! You'll be wanting to know the recipe then, won't you? Why, it's simple enough.
10407 : It's just %, %, %, %, %...
10408 : ...And finally, %. Toss them all into one of those furnace doodads, work your synergy magic on it, trade the product back here to me, and we're in business!
10409 : I suspect you can find the ingredients somewhere strong in elemental energy. Maybe a place with some of those big crystal doohickeys lying around?
10410 : But you're the adventurer. I have bigger flasques to fulminate! Good luck out there!
10411 : I knew you'd be back! How about it? Ready to do the world a favor and help me complete my most marvelous invention?
10412 : What? Don't tell me you've already forgotten the recipe for astral matter. Oh well, not everyone can be as organized as yours truly! Anyway...
10413 : Why, yes! Yes, I'd recognize it anywhere! One hundred percent pure, unadulterated astral whatchama-thingama-doodad-jiggity-callit!!! Now just sit tight for a moment, okay?
10414 : Yes, this is it! The gizmo that will have synergists all over Vana'diel saying, Boy, how did I ever live without that nifty thingamadoo-diggity?
10415 : I dub it the portafurnace! And as a reward for making this day possible, I present you with one of your very own!
10416 : You're impressed, aren't you? Go on and admit it! With this %, you can summon a synergy furnace to your side anytime, anywhere!
10417 : Anywhere, that is, except for busy cities and towns. And dungeons. And inside buildings? And maybe some other places too. Mind you, that's not a defect--it's a feature! Safety first, I always say.
10418 : No, no, you don't have to tell me--I know I'm brilliant! Good day, and may my ingenious invention serve you well!
10419 : Well, if it isn't my favorite adventurer! Synergizing up a storm with the help of my miraculous portafurnace?
10420 : You'll be happy to know that I'm already hard at work on my next invention: a doodad that can take that stuff from one of those whatsits, and convert it to pure whatchamacallit to use with the thingamajigs! Sounds amazing, doesn't it?
10421 : What? Don't tell me you lost the % I made for you. I'm heartbroken! A lot of blood, sweat, and whatchamacallits go into making each and every one of those beauties!
10422 : But hey, I've got a soft spot for discombobulated types like you. Here's a brand-spankin' new one. Just promise me you'll hold onto it this time, okay?
10423 : I can make you another, but it'll be a while before the doojigs are ready to toss into the thingamacallit. Why don't you come back a little later?
10425 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
10426 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
10427 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
10428 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
10436 : Hey, you! I'll have you know that only the rightful leader of the Star Onion Brigade can sit there! Get down right now before I charge you with trees-on and disturbing the peas!
10437 : I don't know how you got inside, but that area is off limits. Vacate the premises immediately!
10438 : He...he...here's your delivery...<wheeze>...!
10439 : Thanks once again. Light on your feet today, I see!
10440 : Walking trees!? How positively...peculiar. Are these also creations conjured up with Tarutaru magic?
10441 : Welcome!
10442 : What can I do for you?
10443 : Go bother someone else. I'm busy!
10444 : Need something sent to a friend's house? Sending items to your own house? You've come to the right place!

10446 : In the Gustaberg Mountains of Southern Quon lies the industrial nation known as the Republic of Bastok.
10447 : Compared to San d'Oria, with its legendary orders of knights, or Windurst, with its ancient institutes of magic, Bastok is still but a newborn nation.
10448 : But advanced technology and near limitless underground resources have allowed Bastok to rival the other two nations in power.
10449 : Innovative and adaptable Humes make up more than half the population of Bastok.
10450 : With their flair for industry, economy, and politics, they were the driving force behind Bastok's rapid growth. Even now, Humes hold key positions in those areas.
10451 : The Galka, a race of hulking humanoids, comprise a third of Bastok's population. Originally hailing from Zepwell, they came to this land over six hundred years ago.
10452 : Without their incomparable strength, the countless ore mines that drive Bastok's economy would never have been dug.
10453 : Adventurers seeking fame and fortune flock to rising nations like Bastok. You are one of them.
10454 : Your story begins here, amid the smoke and bustle of the industrial city of Bastok.
10455 : Excuse me...
10456 : How do I get to the residential area?
10457 : ...
10458 : Uh, hello. I'm new in Bastok. Can you tell me where the residential area is?
10459 : Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were new here, too.
10460 : I guess I'll have to find my way there myself. People aren't too friendly around here, are they?
10461 : Anyways, good luck to the both of us!
10462 : Pesky Hume... Where does he think he is, Windurst? Some day this is turning out to be.
10463 : You're not from around here either, huh? No use denying it... I can smell it.
10464 : If you don't want to get hurt, turn around and go back where you came from.
10465 : Hey, hey! There's no need to be rude.
10466 : Besides, picking on this poor [guy/girl] isn't worth it.
10467 : Oh? Since when do you care what happens to outsiders, Gumbah?
10468 : I'm just saying that one such as you shouldn't bother with their like, O Great Warrior Deidogg.
10469 : Hrmph. Whatever.
10470 : You just remember, outsider, I won't go so easy on you next time.
10471 : Sorry about that. People can be so hard-headed around here sometimes.
10472 : Hey, why the glum look? Don't like being talked to like some new recruit? But it is your first time here, isn't it?
10473 : First time in Bastok? Yes. No.
10474 : Really? Well, you still look like you haven't been around much.
10475 : Is there anything you want to know? Anything you want to do? Maybe I can point you in the right direction.
10476 : What do you want to do? Fight monsters! Go shopping. Find some work.
10477 : Then you shouldn't have to come into the city in the first place.
10478 : Go back the way you came and pass through the South Gate. That'll take you outside.
10479 : Oh, and make sure to always check monsters out before fighting them. You don't want to pick fights with things you can't beat.
10480 : There are some small shops through that arch over there, but...
10481 : If you want better stuff, you should go to the Markets.
10482 : Good call. You should start with a short-term goal to get yourself on track. What kind of work are you looking for?
10483 : What do you want to do? Serve Bastok. Help people. Get rich, quick.
10484 : You should go talk to a gate guard. Try one of the town gates, like the one you just came through.
10485 : That's the spirit! Could you do me a favor then, and help a friend of mine?
10486 : It's the first house down the road through that big arch.
10487 : Well, if I knew anything about that, I wouldn't be here, would I?
10488 : Anyway, maybe Echo Hawk can help you. He's got ears all over the place.
10489 : Take a right and go straight through that entrance. He's usually lurking around there.
10490 : Oh, and take this. It's %. Arva should give you money for it. She's standing around the rear of the general goods store.
10491 : Don't worry, it's not mine. I just found it. Arva should be somewhere around...
10492 : Here. You can check your map again by selecting Map from the main menu on the right.
10493 : Oh, I'm sure you know this already, but if you want to give items to people in town, use Trade from the main menu.
10494 : I guess that's it. I have to run now, but I'm sure we'll meet again!
10495 : I have nothing for you today. Sometimes, even I run out of information.
10496 : What's this? Haven't seen you around here before.
10497 : For a newcomer, you're off to a good start... You've come to talk to me.
10498 : I'm Echo Hawk. I trade in information.
10499 : Don't bother asking the hard-headed Galka around here--they're too busy contemplating their navels. But not me. I've got info on stuff most people have never even heard of.
10500 : Don't worry about money. I make it my policy not to take gil from rookies like you.
10501 : My sources even pay me in special cases, you know.
10502 : Anyway, I've heard that this old Hume, Wahid, is looking for a rare gem. You can find him at the auction house on the other side of this neighborhood.
10503 : Apparently, it's supposed to be part of some legend, but I don't deal with that kind of nonsense. Go talk to the bard at the tavern. Fairy tales are his specialty.
10504 : You can probably find him in the Port District. He's not the type to hang around this kind of seedy neighborhood.
10505 : Good hunting, then. Come back whenever you need more info.
10506 : You are at the South Gate, in the Bastok Mines District. The West Gate is in the Markets, while the North Gate in the port.
10507 : Ever since the new president came into office, all manner of public works are falling behind schedule.
10508 : He shouldn't meddle with things that don't concern him, and let Chief Cid do his job. Doesn't he realize he's just a figurehead anyway?
10509 : What? The stamp hunt? You came all this way for that, huh? Here you go.
10510 : You received a stamp!
10511 : There are two dungeons outside the city of Bastok: The Palborough Mines in North Gustaberg, and the Dangruf Wadi in South Gustaberg.
10512 : This neighborhood's pretty rough. Be careful.
10513 : Hmm? You the new miner? Nah, you look like an adventurer. Here to pound some monsters into pudding, are you?
10514 : Just don't cause any trouble, all right? We've got enough to worry about with these Galka. Only thing their long lives have given them are hard heads. Eesh.
10515 : Bastok's foundations were built with the ore taken from this mine. It took the Galka a lot of sweat and toil to dig this mine. We made Bastok what it is today.
10516 : %? Yeah, used to have some of that, a long time ago. Don't have any anymore, though.
10517 : You should be able to find some near the coast of the Valkurm Dunes...but only during dust storms.
10518 : Those Humes are full of talk about how they dug the mythril mines with their great technology, but it didn't do them much good when the Quadav came, did it?
10519 : Welcome to the Palborough Mines--made by Humes, full of Quadav. Good catch phrase for their mythril mines, don't you think?
10520 : Bastok sure has changed over the years. About the only things that don't change are us Galka, working in the mines.
10521 : There's an inn and the Alchemists' Guild through here, but other than that, you'll only find the homes of Bastok's poor. I don't think there's anything you'd want in there.
10522 : What's the matter? Are you lost?
10523 : Ask for directions? Ask. Don't ask.
10524 : Where do you want to go?
10525 : Which area would you like to ask about? The South Gate and the residential area. The Markets and the Mines. The mining town and Alchemists' Guild. Uh, never mind.
10526 : Hmm. Well, just don't wander into places you don't know. It could be dangerous.
10527 : See that big building south from here, on the left?
10528 : That's the auction house. You can buy other people's items or sell items yourself there.
10529 : You can send items to your friends there as well. Just talk to the Galkan deliveryman on post.
10530 : If you keep going south, you'll find the South Gate.
10531 : Go through it to go to South Gustaberg. If you are a Bastoker, you can also receive missions from the guard at the gatehouse.
10532 : If you go left from the South Gate toward the east, you'll come across another building.
10533 : That's where you'll find the Chocobo Stables. You can rent chocobos there to help you on those long trips.
10534 : If you go further east, you'll come to the entrance to the residential area. Go on inside if you want to drop off items in your room.
10535 : If you are not from Bastok, however, you'll need to get a Rent-a-Room first.
10536 : Go through the arch west of here.
10537 : You will see a road sloping down on your right. Walk down that road to go to the Markets district.
10538 : If you go straight west, you'll be able to see the entrance to the mines.
10539 : Inside the mines you will find miners, of course--but also monsters. You should be careful.
10540 : To the north of this fork there are two arches, one big and one small.
10541 : The big arch leads to the lower level of the mining town, while the small one leads to its surface level.
10542 : If you walk through the small arch to the surface level, you'll find an inn to your left.
10543 : Across from the inn is the armory.
10544 : If you go further down the road, you'll come across a goods shop and the back exit of the mining town.
10545 : Go through the exit and you'll be behind the auction house.
10546 : You'll also find stairs off to the side, midway down the mining town street. Those connect the surface and lower levels.
10547 : At the far end of the lower level, to the east, is where you'll find the Alchemists' Guild.
10548 : That's about it. I can explain it to you again, but it might be better for you to just go to those places yourself and talk to the people there.
10549 : What do you want? This is no place for the likes of you. Get out.
10550 : What? Gumbah sent you, you say?
10551 : That he would ask a newborn pup like you... Are his eyes failing him, at such a young age?
10552 : Well, I suppose you'll just have to do. He put his trust in you, so I must do the same.
10553 : I am currently employed by the Tenshodo, and my task is to collect five % for them.
10554 : Alas, I was injured when I obtained the fourth. It will be some time before I can go out to find the fifth.
10555 : The Tenshodo took the first four, but they refuse to hand me my reward until the last one is in their hands.
10556 : I am sure they would not have told me that had I not been injured.
10557 : If you would, could you give Talib of the Tenshodo the last %, in my name?
10558 : He should then hand you a certain item as reward. I would be very grateful if you could bring it to me.
10559 : Take on this task? Yes. No.
10560 : That is...unfortunate.
10561 : Thank you. Oh, before you go, I should tell you that a Hume is also undertaking the same task.
10562 : She is not an adventurer, and hardly more than a child. Believe me, I did not ask her to do this for me, yet she has run off to do it.
10563 : Her name? I believe she called herself Cornelia.
10564 : Would you keep an eye out for her and keep her out of trouble, especially at the Tenshodo? I could not bear it if anything happened to her.
10565 : Hmm? Yes, I am Parraggoh. Ah, Cornelia told you of my predicament.
10566 : Well, then. She put her trust in you, so I will do the same.
10567 : Thank you. It pains me to have to rely on people's kindness like this, but you have my gratitude.
10568 : It pains me to have to rely on people's kindness like this, but you have my gratitude.
10569 : I must thank Cornelia for her kindness as well...
10570 : Ah! You have brought me %!
10571 : Hmm? Yes, I am Parraggoh.
10572 : What? Cornelia asked you...and you've brought me %?
10573 : Thank you! I really needed these!
10574 : It may not be much of a reward, but I want you to have this.
10575 : If you see Cornelia, send her my gratitude.
10576 : No, wait-- Instead, tell her she should not be seen around us Galka too much.
10577 : For her own sake.
10578 : Ah! It's good to see you again. How have you been?
10579 : This is no place for you to be wandering around. Get out of my sight, outsider.
10580 : Have you seen Gumbah? Yes. No.
10581 : Okay. If you see him again, tell him not to run away next time!
10582 : What? He ran away again?
10583 : He never stands his ground! But I'll get him next time!
10584 : Hey, you! Did you see a small Galka called Gumbah?
10585 : I'm here. What do you want?
10586 : Ah! Finally, we meet again! Prepare to face your doom!
10587 : Oh, not again. Didn't I beat you last time? You've always been such a pestering child...
10588 : Hey, you're not much older than I am! Don't talk to me like you're some old man!
10589 : And you cheated last time! You brought one of Werei's old swords!
10590 : You didn't say I couldn't. Besides, you cheated first. I saw you borrow Deidogg's sword.
10591 : Urk... Well, uh...forget swords! This time, it's helms! Whoever brings the best helm wins! And don't bring any of Werei's, Gumbah!
10592 : Oh, please... Fine, I forfeit. You win. Can I go now?
10593 : No, no, no! You're not running away again!
10594 : Anyway, I'm thinking of bringing %. Hey, you're an adventurer, right? You have one, don't you?
10595 : Can I borrow it for just a few seconds? I'll give it back, promise! I'll even give you a reward!
10596 : Ooh! %! Thanks! Now I'll show that Gumbah...
10597 : You're borrowing again...
10598 : There you are! Ha-ha! Look, I have %! Victory is mine!
10599 : Uh-huh, good for you. My helm should be here soon.
10600 : There you are! Here, I brought the % you asked for!
10601 : How's this? Do I win?
10602 : Hey! That's not fair! You tricked her into bringing you that helm!
10603 : Huh? Tricked? What's going on? Where's the Galka adventurer who needed a helm?
10604 : Gumbah! Were you lying to me? Explain yourself!
10605 : Well, uh... I gotta go!
10606 : Hey! If you run, I win! Ha! What do you say to that!?
10607 : Fine by me! See you!
10608 : Gumbah! Come back here this instant!
10609 : Why do I feel like I've lost? Anyway, thanks. Here's the reward I promised you.
10610 : I'm here in Bastok to investigate a few things about the Palborough Mines.
10611 : You're an adventurer, aren't you? Could you do me a favor?
10612 : There is a monument at the top of Zegham Hill in North Gustaberg, erected in honor of the pioneers who dug the Palborough Mines.
10613 : My great-grandfather was one of them. I wanted to go visit his grave there, but I couldn't get past all the monsters.
10614 : If it's not too much trouble, I was wondering if you could place this % at the monument for me.
10615 : Visit the monument in Elki's stead? Yes. No.
10616 : Thank you. There are ten names engraved on the monument. Look for an Omran. He was my great-grandfather.
10617 : Of course... I'm sorry. Asking a total stranger to risk his life for me... I was being presumptuous.
10618 : Thank you for your kindness. It's good to hear that Omran's name is still there, after all these years.
10619 : There was an eleventh name? Vig****t O**? No, I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. Wait, unless...
10620 : No, never mind. Thank you again. Here, this is for your trouble.
10621 : Ah, it's you. Thank you for the other day. As you might have guessed, visiting my great-grandfather's grave was not the only thing I came here to do.
10622 : Upon further examination of my great-grandfather's diary, I've come to believe that there were eleven pioneers who dug the Palborough Mines, not ten.
10623 : My great-grandfather seemed to truly regret the fact that this last pioneer's name was never recorded in the annals alongside theirs.
10624 : I believe the name you found, this Vig****t O**, is the name of that last pioneer...
10625 : But I can't seem to find a name to fit those letters. It has been more than a hundred fifty years, so I don't think he'd still be alive, but...
10626 : If you can find any information on this person, I'd be truly grateful.
10627 : Help investigate? Ask for more information. Help. Don't help.
10628 : The Palborough Mines were the first mines to be dug using explosives, a Hume invention.
10629 : Before then, Bastok had to rely on the strength of the Galka to dig its mines. When the ten Hume pioneers dug one using only their wits and technology, it was a major turning point in Bastok's history.
10630 : Any other clue that might shed light on the Palborough Mines' past would be in the mines themselves.
10631 : Thank you. If you find anything out, please tell me right away.
10632 : I see... Thanks anyway.
10633 : Eleven sets of tools? The names of the pioneers are written on them...
10634 : The eleventh pioneer's name was...Vigilant Owl? It sounds like a Galka name.
10635 : And they say the Palborough Mines were dug only by Humes...
10636 : Wait, there's another inscription on this tool... Babenn? Is that another name?
10637 : I wonder what this means... I'll try to find out more on my side, but let me know if you come across any more information.
10638 : An eleventh Palborough Mines Pioneer? Then it is as I thought!
10639 : % you brought me--the more I read them, the more I am convinced someone has tampered with them!
10640 : It must be Humes! Only they would go so far as erasing our history to protect their over-swollen pride!
10641 : I... My apologies. I should not let my emotions get the better of me.
10642 : The pioneers? Well, yes, I worked in the mines until fifteen years ago, but you're talking about things that happened more than a hundred and fifty years back!
10643 : I may be old, but I'm not that old. Go talk to Babenn. Now that Werei's gone, he's the only Galka left who was around back then.
10644 : The Palborough Pioneers? Yes, I was alive back then, but I recall I was away adventuring in those days. I'm afraid I can't help you with what you seek.
10645 : Hmm? What is it you want with an old Galka like me?
10646 : Vigilant...Owl? That name does not mean anything to me.
10647 : I have nothing to tell you. Go, and take that old toolbox with you.
10648 : Ah, now I understand...
10649 : Is that why you don't like talking about the past, then, Babenn?
10650 : But it's been more than a hundred and fifty years. Don't you think it's time you told your story?
10651 : Gumbah... What are you doing here?
10652 : You must've figured it out by now, right? Galka in Bastok have two names.
10653 : One is our given name. The other...a name that Humes give us if they can't pronounce the first one.
10654 : Vigilant Owl...that was what they called you, wasn't it, Babenn? You've told me before...and I haven't forgotten.
10655 : Meddling child... That was more than a century ago. That name belongs in the past.
10656 : Wait... Who's there? Show yourself!
10657 : My great-grandfather did not forget, Sir Vigilant Owl... No, Sir Babenn.
10658 : Omran...!? No, you cannot be him. Humes do not live longer than a hundred years.
10659 : Omran was my great-grandfather. He used to tell me about the mines when I was young...but whenever he did, it was with sadness and regret.
10660 : He often said: If you manage to achieve anything worthwhile in life, it is because you were lucky enough to have met the best people anyone could meet.
10661 : Omran said that?
10662 : Listen and remember, heir to Omran. In those days, Humes were in need of pride. Pride in having dug a mine without anyone else's help.
10663 : My name had no place on their monument, and this I accepted.
10664 : Some need their achievements carved in stone, even though stone can weather and fade. It was a small price I paid for their fame.
10665 : No! My great-grandfather did not seek fame!
10666 : He used to tell me the days he spent digging those mines were the best of his life!
10667 : Enough. You know as well as I do that Galka and Humes do not live in the same flow of time.
10668 : ...
10669 : But I can tell you one thing. A hundred and fifty years ago, during those few days when we sought for mythril in the cold, dark tunnels...we saw the world with the same eyes.
10670 : And that, to me, is enough. No matter what people say, and even if the others are long gone, my memories are still with me.
10671 : Heir to Omran, seek not the trueness of our bond in days long past, but that of bonds you share with others in this time, in this world.
10672 : ...I understand. Farewell, sir.
10673 : That was pretty complicated... I really hope he understood.
10674 : You're the one who complicated matters. You brought him here, did you not?
10675 : And where did you hear about my past? I don't remember telling you.
10676 : Oh, really? That's weird... Uh...I think Werei told me, yeah.
10677 : Anyways, I gotta run! Bye!
10678 : It seems I owe you an apology. This is for bringing my old toolbox back to me. Take it.
10679 : Hmm? What is it you want with an old Galka like me?
10680 : Nothing of value has been put up for sale in the auctions lately. The Quadav's influence on Bastok's mine digs may be more severe than I thought.
10681 : Wahid, at your service. I am a collector of precious gems.
10682 : Mind you, I am not interested in stones with only monetary value. Gems of legend, with value that cannot be weighed in gold...those, a true collector seeks.
10683 : Currently, I am seeking a stone called %. It is said that one can occasionally find these on the shores of the rivers in the Gustaberg Mountains.
10684 : They are quite hard to find, I hear, so search thoroughly.
10685 : What's more, I have heard accounts of people trying to pick one up, only to have it slip through their fingers and flow down the river once more.
10686 : Many adventurers like yourself have tried their hand, so to speak, but they all came back...well, empty-handed. I heard that those of great mettle had an especially hard time.
10687 : There once was a bard who managed to bring one back...but he said that it would be the first and last time for him. Whether he was unable or unwilling to go back, I do not know.
10688 : From what I've heard, he now spends his time singing in a tavern somewhere...
10689 : At any rate, if you go to the river and find one for me, I will give you a reward.
10690 : Oh-ho! %! Good work!
10691 : Yes, yes! Look how it glitters! Marvelous, simply marvelous! If you find any more, come to me and I will reward you handsomely!
10692 : My mom's the greatest adventurer ever! Every time she comes back, she brings me lots of neat gifts!
10693 : Walk down this road to go to the Markets District. This is also the road for the Metalworks and the Port District.
10694 : Mom says it's dangerous in there, and I can't go in...
10695 : But someday, I will go inside! Everyone knows that when grown-ups say that kind of thing, they're just trying to keep a fun place to themselves!
10696 : After a Galka lives for more than two hundred years, he reincarnates. Unfortunately, he retains no memory of his past life. But every generation, there is one Galka who does.
10697 : He remembers everything about his past, and he becomes the Talekeeper, the leader of all Galka. Alas, we lost our Talekeeper thirty years ago.
10698 : I have lived more than two hundred years, but I have yet to see any improvement in our relationship with the Humes of Bastok.
10699 : The loss of our Talekeeper has only worsened things... It has cast a dark shadow over the hearts of all Galka.
10700 : Most Galka around here don't like Humes much.
10701 : That's why we don't call ourselves by the names Humes give us.
10702 : Werei was the oldest Galka around here. He was really strong when he was young, you know.
10703 : He's the one who taught Iron Eater, the only Galka in the Mythril Musketeers, how to fight.
10704 : This area is off-limits.
10705 : You're here for the stamp hunt, right? Here you go. I wonder why so many adventurers are participating in this thing. But then again, I wouldn't want children running around here, either.
10706 : Even with all of Bastok's vaunted technological progress, chocobos, especially of the San d'Orian variety, are still favored by adventurers as rides.
10707 : And of course, our chocobos are imported directly from San d'Oria!
10708 : Twenty years ago, there was a war between us and the beastmen. Captain Volker of the Mythril Musketeers and Chief Engineer Cid became heroes in that war...
10709 : But that is Hume history. Few but us know that we lost our best swordsman, the dark knight Zeid, during that conflict. He still hasn't been found, either alive or dead.
10710 : Of course, to Humes, it's just a historical detail, soon forgotten.
10711 : The loss of Talekeeper Raogrimm thirty years ago, and the more recent loss of Zeid, have struck us hard in this time of need.
10712 : We Galka are inherently united by the presence of our Talekeeper. With him absent, we are like a shipwrecked crew, lost and drifting in the dark...
10713 : Bastok is a scary-wary place! Open warfare with the Quadav! Everyone fighting!
10714 : Windurst is so different! Very peaceful! We bash-mash Yagudo sometimes, yes, but at least we try to talk to them first!
10715 : Killing each other isn't the way! My little-brittle bones are shaking!
10716 : Bastokers are always grumpy-frumpy because they're fighting all the time!
10717 : Honestly speaking, the Galka in this district scare me the most, even more so than the Quadav...
10718 : Oopsy-doopsy. That was not a nice thing for me to say! Please don't tell anyone I said that!
10719 : What? The Gusgen Mines? Oh, you want to know about glocolite.
10720 : I should warn you, it's not worth the risk. But you're on official business, right?
10721 : There are pools of groundwater in those mines. A special monster lives in one of them, but you'll have to lure it out.
10722 : Trade some bait to a special spot on the ground, and it'll come.
10723 : It likes %, so use one of those. All you have to do is defeat it and you'll get your %. There are a lot of rivers there, mind you, but only one spot where it appears. Anyway, good luck!
10724 : I thought I told you I don't want any help, I-- Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. She won't stop pestering me...
10725 : Hiya, Mister Pavvke! How's your health?
10726 : I knew you'd be back... I might be old, but I'm not dying yet.
10727 : Oops, sorry. That was Parraggoh...
10728 : Anyway, I went and asked adventurers near the Metalworks if they'd ever seen the % you told me about, but no one knew anything about them.
10729 : That's very kind of you, but it's been over fifteen years since the accident... I have to face the fact that my friends, and their belongings, are gone forever.
10730 : No, don't give up! I'm sure we'll find something!
10731 : ...
10732 : Hey, have you ever been to the Palborough Mines? Did you see any % lying around?
10733 : I used to work in the Palborough Mines with many other Galka. Twenty years ago, an explosive went off before we'd cleared the tunnels, and suddenly we were surrounded by Quadav.
10734 : Many Galka died that day... I am looking for their %. The fallen need to be remembered.
10735 : I'm kind of a Bastokan history buff, and Mister Pavvke's been teaching me a lot. But when he told me about the Palborough Mines... I had to try helping him.
10736 : If you find any %, could you bring them to him? I'll pay you, of course.
10737 : No, Cornelia, you shouldn't. I couldn't ask that of you. I will pay the reward myself.
10738 : ...All right. Well, I should go talk to some more adventurers. One of them is bound to know something!
10739 : <Sigh> It's not that I don't appreciate it, but she shouldn't involve herself in other people's business like this...
10740 : Y-you've found %! In the Palborough Mines, yes?
10741 : Thank you! You don't know what this means to me.
10742 : There should be others where you found this one. If you find them, please bring them to me. I'm sorry I can't give you much, but here's your reward.
10743 : I'm glad you found it! I knew you would! What? Why am I out here?
10744 : Well, Mister Pavvke would probably scold me if I tried to give you a reward. He'd say something like, she should not be meddling in our affairs...
10745 : I know, I know. He's right. But I can't help it. Whenever I decide to do something, I just can't think of anything else.
10746 : You know something? The more I listen to Mister Pavvke's stories, the more I can see the gap in understanding between the Galka and Humes.
10747 : But the Galka shouldn't be blamed for that, you know? Humes haven't exactly been nice to them, putting them to work and all... Most of the people who died in the accident Mister Pavvke was caught in were Galka, too.
10748 : I wish I could somehow bridge the gap between the Galka and Humes... Well then! Enough talk, I have to go. See you around!
10749 : Oh! A prrresent from Mom! Thank you for bringing it!
10750 : Wait, don't go yet! Here, could you give this to Mom? Please?
10751 : A present for Mom? Umm... I think she should be home soon.
10752 : Hey kitten, I'm home!
10753 : Mom! This stranger's brought a prrresent for you!
10754 : A present? Oh, right! You went to the Konschtat Highlands, then? What did you find? C'mon, show me!
10755 : Huh? %? Doesn't look like anyone famous painted it, either...
10756 : Mom? If you don't want it, can I have it? I like it! It's prrretty!
10757 : Of course, darling. Here. Well, at least my daughter's happy. I'm sorry, but for something like that, I can't pay you more than this...
10758 : Hi! You know, we also had a visitor before Werei left...
10759 : I apologize for bothering you again. I wished to speak with you about Zeid...
10760 : Hey, Werei? The Musketeer's back again.
10761 : Captain Volker... We Galka would also like to know of Zeid's whereabouts, but none of us knows where he might be.
10762 : You must understand, I cannot continue to perform my duties with a clear conscience unless I know what became of him. As you know, Zeid is the one who should be leading the Mythril Musketeers, not I.
10763 : Is it your uncle you think of when you say this? True, many Galka were upset by his appointment as Captain after Raogrimm disappeared, but...
10764 : We do not feel the same way about you. As Zeid is different from Raogrimm, you are very different from your uncle.
10765 : ...It is not because of my uncle, sir.
10766 : I am glad to hear that. I now feel safe in telling you that a dark knight was sighted in the Palborough Mines. He was very powerful, I am told.
10767 : Then it is...?
10768 : That is all I know.
10769 : So...why are there less dark knights since Zeid disappeared? Any idea?
10770 : Well... Zeid did, in a sense, create his own version of the art, passed down since the glory days of Altepa. And it is not something one can master with skill alone.
10771 : It is said that only the few who can tame the dark flames that burn within their soul, feeding on their sorrow and hatred...are chosen.
10772 : ...That's one of the last things I remember Werei saying. Say, why don't you go find Zeid yourself? Maybe he can teach you how to become a dark knight, too.
10773 : Though Werei once told me that the road to becoming one is not an easy one to take.
10774 : What to do, what to do? Ah, an adventurer! Could you help out a lowly trader? I'm working as an intermediary between the Metalworks and the Alchemists' Guild.
10775 : I'm supposed to get them some materials for this collaborative project they're working on, and I got everything except for %.
10776 : Sounds easy, right? I only have to fill % with water from the Drachenfall in North Gustaberg.
10777 : The problem is, I can't find a place where I can get close enough to the falls to scoop some water up. Would you mind going in my place? Here, I'll give you %.
10778 : Oh, it's you. Did you lose the %? Here, I'll give you another one. Don't lose it this time.
10779 : You got it! Thank the heavens! You saved my neck! Here, take this, you deserve it!
10780 : Hume bigwigs don't bother comin' around here, so traders like me can go about their business all unconstrained-like. Heh-heh.
10781 : The workers in the mines and those who went out to avenge them...many of my brethren were slain by the Quadav.
10782 : I want the Quadav to pay for what they did, so that the souls of my fallen comrades may rest in peace.
10783 : I want you to go to the Quadav stronghold in Beadeaux and kill as many of them as you can. Bring me back % as proof of your deeds, and I will reward you.
10784 : Good work. Now the souls of my brethren can finally rest in peace.
10785 : The government won't do anything about the monsters in the Zeruhn Mines. It's not cost-effective. But those things always get in the way of work, you know?
10786 : If you can go in there and kill a few, my buddies and I will put together a reward for you. Oh, and don't forget to bring me three % as proof you did the job.
10787 : Good work! We could use more people like you!
10788 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Ronfaure, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
10789 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Fauregandi, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
10790 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Norvallen, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
10791 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Valdeaunia, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
10792 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Li'Telor, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
10793 : Hey, you're an adventurer, right? Could you take this note to my husband? He forgot to take it with him.
10794 : My husband's name is Zelman. You'll find him in the Zeruhn Mines. He's a miner. All right, then, off you go!
10795 : What? He thinks doing the groceries isn't dignified? Ha! That's a laugh! And just who does he think's putting food on the table while he's off taking naps in that little hole of his!?
10796 : You bought this, didn't you? Hmm... I was going to give this present to my husband, since he needed some cheering up lately, but...
10797 : Since you did his chores for him, it's yours. Well, he always wanted to be an adventurer himself, so he should be happy knowing you have it.
10798 : Ah, did you find my husband? Good. I keep telling him to check his pockets before he leaves, but he never does. Anyway, here, take this. For your trouble.
10799 : My husband used to listen to me a lot more when we were young. It'd be funny if he was going through a rebellious phase at his age!
10800 : What do you want? Oh, you think because I'm just a kid you can walk over and talk to me for no good reason?
10801 : True, I might look like a child now, but I know I was once a great warrior, and I can prove it.
10802 : Do you want to see proof? Yes. No.
10803 : I wasn't going to show you anyway. I know your type. Patting kids on the head and thinking how great life was when you were their age, right? Spare me, please.
10804 : I thought so. Well...all right, here. But be careful! It's very, very valuable--it's a piece of my past life.
10805 : A friend gave this to me over twenty years ago. I can't remember what it all means, though.
10806 : I showed this to my friend Gumbah once, and his opinion was that this is a very valuable document that tells you each monster type's weakness.
10807 : He said it will come in handy when I become an adventurer.
10808 : You've been a good pupil. Come back anytime if you want to see it again. Well, at least until I leave on my first adventure...

10921 : Hey, [miss/mister], you met Zeid, didn't you? You know, the dark knight?
10922 : He wrote you a letter. I think he meant for Werei to give it to you, but since I got it, I had to open it to find out who it was for. Sorry.
10923 : I think he says he's waiting in a mine somewhere. Are you training to become a dark knight, too? Wow, it must be really hard.
10924 : Welcome to the auction house. Do you have any questions about our establishment?
10925 : What do you want to know? What is the auction house? How are auctions run? Are there any fees? Are there any limits? How do you check up on merchandise? How do you remove an item? My Sales Status list is full! Nothing right now.
10926 : Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.
10927 : Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.
10928 : Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.
10929 : The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.
10930 : Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).
10931 : If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.
10932 : Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.
10933 : A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.
10934 : The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.
10935 : However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.
10936 : A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.
10937 : Once an item appears on your Sales Status list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.
10938 : If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select Stop Sale from the Sales Status menu.
10939 : To remove an item from your Sales Status list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.
10940 : Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.
10941 : At any auction counter, open the Sales Status menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.
10942 : Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).
10943 : Is there anything else you would like to know?
10944 : In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!
10945 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
10946 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
10947 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
10948 : Oh, what a cruel, cruel master, kupo!!!
10949 : Thank you, kupo! I...have one more favor to ask. It's almost time for the festival in the moogles' hometown, kupo!
10950 : Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him % as a gift, kupo!
10951 : Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and % would make the perfect present, kupo!

10958 : Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!
10959 : Here's your present--a shiny new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 60 items, kupo!
10960 : Looking at that shabby old bed makes me feel homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
10961 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
10962 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
10963 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
10964 : Thank you, kupo! I have one more favor to ask... I want to take my family on a picnic, kupo!
10965 : Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
10966 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!
10967 : But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
10968 : Papa Mog is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
10969 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!

10975 : The capacity of your Mog Safe has increased!
10976 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
10977 : After resting on the %, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?
10978 : Give your moogle some time off? Have fun, kupo! No, I am your only friend now!
10979 : Oh, thank you, master! My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!
10980 : The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take % for my friends there, kupo!
10981 : And my other buddies need % for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!
10982 : I can't help out my friends if I don't have % and %, kupo...
10983 : I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!
10984 : Master! I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!
10985 : We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!
10986 : I am Virnage, a friar, from the San d'Oria Cathedral. Coming to Bastok is part of my pilgrimage.
10987 : I was to return to San d'Oria after praying at the Crag of Dem...
10988 : But I've seen something horrible here that demanded that I stay. The statue of the Goddess in the Metalworks--yes, its placement is deplorable, too--its paint is peeling off!
10989 : I cannot believe that no one here noticed! That statue's paint is specifically made to endure the rigors of time! It is supposed to last dozens of years!
10990 : Ah, but there is hope. I once read an account of friars carrying off a batch of paint with them as they sought a place of safety during the Great War!
10991 : They stayed in a citadel on the Sauromugue Champaign. The paint may be there still! I have heard people here say you are a great adventurer. Please, help the Goddess in Her hour of need!
10992 : Please, the Goddess needs your help!
10993 : Ah! You've found the %! May the Goddess bless your soul!
10994 : I would like to repay you for your deeds, but I have nothing to give you at the moment.
10995 : Here, I will give you this letter. Bring it to Eperdur in the San d'Oria Cathedral. I am sure he will give you a reward.
10996 : May the Gates of Paradise open for you.
10997 : Hand my letter to Eperdur in the San d'Oria Cathedral to claim your reward.
10998 : The Goddess's image has been restored! Yet...I've received word from the cathedral that my pilgrimage is not yet complete.
10999 : The Gates of Paradise are very far, indeed...
11000 : Good day, young whipper-snapper. You look as if you've been working hard.
11001 : Good day, young [lad/lass]. I can see that you've become quite the adventurer. When you get to be my age, you can tell these things, you know.
11002 : My darling son, may his soul rest in peace, was a warrior, and so was my grandson...until he decided to quit and become a doorman.
11003 : My son didn't teach him how to wield a sword so he could go waste his skill on being a doorman. That boy just doesn't understand...
11004 : He didn't even take his father's sword with him.
11005 : Sure, it may be a little old and may need a few repairs. I think that the handle requires some kind of special part...
11006 : I remember my son saying he had found % in a tent when he and some great Galka named Ragarimin, or something like that, went on an expedition to the Orcs' stronghold.
11007 : If you happen to stop by there on your way somewhere, picking some up would make me ever so grateful.
11008 : Well I'll be! You've brought me %! I'll ask my sweetie in the Blacksmiths' Guild to fix it all up, good as new.
11009 : I'm sorry. I have no way to repay you now. Could you please come back tomorrow?
11010 : Thanks to you, my son's sword is as good as it was the day it was forged. I'm sorry to bother you any further, but could you take this to my grandson?
11011 : To get to where he's stationed, I hear you have to ride this newfangled elevatie contraption.
11012 : They say that doormen get decent pay, so you can get your reward from my grandson. I'm sure he won't mind.
11013 : His name? Oh, it's Naji.
11014 : So, you took the sword to my grandson? Hmm...and the sword was connected to that Sir Ragimorimm character?
11015 : Now that you mention it, when Sir Ragamuffimm was a young'un, he was always acting all grown-up. Why do you suppose that is..?
11016 : All those Galka praising the likes of him... Except for one. There was one who hated that Sir Ragamamm.
11017 : Yes, I remember my son having a bit of trouble with that fellow. I think his name was Deidogolly, or something like that.
11018 : What do you think you're looking at? Huh? Deidogolly? What did that old Phara woman say? That nonsense has nothing to do with me.
11019 : What? You're still here? I don't know anything about any pesky old Hume woman. Raogrimm and Yasin? Yeah, I knew them. Raogrimm and I were the same age, too.
11020 : Sure, he was the Talekeeper. Sure, when he was reborn the same year as I was, he had two hundred years of knowledge.
11021 : Of course I hated him. Raogrimm the know-it-all, acting like an elder when he was just a kid... Always adored by everyone...
11022 : And on top of that, becoming a Musketeer to win the favor of the Humes--how low can you get!? I even heard rumors that he was having relations with one of their females.
11023 : Yeah, yeah. I heard the story about him taking down some mighty Quadav in the Palborough Mines, but I don't believe it.
11024 : He was told to bring back a certain item as proof, but you know, he never did.
11025 : The beast did not carry one. That's what he said, but it's a lie. A lie he told to gain fame. I bet you he never went anywhere near the beast's lair.
11026 : You seem strong enough. Why don't you go and see if you can take down that Quadav? They say it appears deep in the Palborough Mines in some room where the Quadav keep their eggs.
11027 : If you can bring back %, then it will prove that Raogrimm was a fake!
11028 : What!? You managed to get %!? This proves it! Raogrimm was a liar!
11029 : Talekeeper... Hah! He was nothing but a fake!
11030 : Greetings, Deidogg.
11031 : You! If it isn't Pagdako...I mean, Iron Eater. What, the Humes finally let you off your leash?
11032 : I have some business in this area, but that is of no importance. I hear that you have been speaking ill of Sir Raogrimm again.
11033 : Yeah...yeah, I have. And why not? Raogrimm lied about killing that Quadav just to gain fame.
11034 : ...What are you implying?
11035 : Ah, I see. You are still going on about that...
11036 : Sir Raogrimm fought the beastmen for the good of his countrymen. He would never steal trophies for his own profit or fame.
11037 : The order was for him to take down the Quadav, not to retrieve the item.
11038 : And, I have also heard that Sir Raogrimm himself questioned many of his orders, finding them at odds with his moral beliefs.
11039 : What does that have to do with anything!?
11040 : But there was one time, and one time only, when Sir Raogrimm took an item from a monster.
11041 : He needed it to finish a new pair of greaves he had promised to a friend.
11042 : Greaves... You don't mean...
11043 : He traveled to Castle Oztroja to obtain a rare % from the leeches there... It was with this item that he completed his friend's greaves.
11044 : That friend would always talk ill of him, but was the only one who would treat him as an equal.
11045 : I can't... Why would he... There is no way he could go all the way to Oztroja...a-and I've never heard of such an item anyway.
11046 : %! Where did you get this!?
11047 : So you really do get these from the leeches in Castle Oztroja... He went all the way there to keep his promise...
11048 : Yes, I do have greaves made of this material. They were sent to me with an unsigned note that only said, The greaves I promised.
11049 : His promise... It had to be when...
11050 : Raogrimm! What's keeping you?
11051 : My apologies. The ceremonial outfits adults give me are too cumbersome--especially these shoes.
11052 : Whatever. It sounds to me like you're just spoiled. You're the Talekeeper, right? You should be able to choose your own shoes.
11053 : But I can't just ignore their good will.
11054 : Oh, come on! Here, you can have these. They're pretty light. Don't worry, I got two pairs the other day.
11055 : Thanks... How can I repay you?
11056 : You, the boy who can get anything he wants? I don't need any of that junk. When you get strong enough to go out on your own, you can get me something a hundred times better than the shoes I just gave you.
11057 : It must have been that promise... Why would he remember something stupid like that? Even I didn't remember until now...
11058 : Anyway, I thank you. Those greaves are old now, but I can repair them with this new %.
11059 : My days of battle are over. I would like you to have the greaves. Stop by tomorrow morning to pick them up.
11060 : I've finished the greaves. These hold the soul of Raogrimm. Use them as he would have.
11061 : I hate saying this to an outsider like you, but...thanks. And that's all I'm going to say.
11062 : Hey, remember when Iron Eater showed up here?
11063 : He was gathering information about Raogrimm. I hear that they are starting up some operation to collect his lost items...
11064 : And so I got this idea...
11065 : ...Wait. I can't be asking outsiders for help. It's just not like me. Forget what I said!
11066 : Oh, if it isn't Gwill. So what's the occasion? Is Dalzakk off adventuring?
11067 : Yeah...
11068 : You don't look so good, Gwill. You're not being teased by those Hume kids again, are you?
11069 : Well, not really teased...
11070 : You wimp! Why do you let those creeps push you around like that? With your strength, you could teach them a lesson.
11071 : If you won't do it, I could always...
11072 : No, no. That's okay... It's just that Arawn and Emrys don't understand...
11073 : What do you mean, don't understand?
11074 : Detzo, do you think that % taste good?
11075 : Huh? What do you mean? Well, I've never tried one anyway, so I wouldn't know. But from what I hear, they're supposed to taste pretty good.
11076 : I guess I'd have to try one to really find out.
11077 : Yeah... Well, the thing is, I have tried one before. Dalzakk brought some back from his adventures once. Anyway, it was really good.
11078 : When I told this to Arawn and Emrys, they said that there was no way that a cookie with ginger in it could be that delicious.
11079 : That's so stupid... They're stupid for saying something like that, and you are just as stupid for getting all upset over it.
11080 : If you can't stick up for yourself over something like that, then you shouldn't talk to those guys anymore. Just stay home and read books like you always do, you pitiful excuse for a Galka!
11081 : Okay... Bye...
11082 : What a case! You know, I think I heard somebody talking about %...
11083 : Yeah, I remember now. Deidogg said that he used to eat them with his friend a long time ago.
11084 : Hey. Isn't this %? Where did you get this?
11085 : ...I see Detzo has a big mouth. Yeah, this brings back memories. Raogrimm and I always used to eat these.
11086 : That's right. You're the one who wanted to hear about the operation to find some of Raogrimm's lost items.
11087 : Many years ago, Raogrimm was sent as an envoy to San d'Oria. As a gesture of friendship, he offered his armor to the Knights of San d'Oria.
11088 : But apparently it was recently stolen. To San d'Oria, this is an enormous blunder, and the high-ups in Bastok are determined to get it back first.
11089 : Bastok wants to use the armor as a bargaining tool with San d'Oria. Unbelievable what outrageous plans those Humes think up...
11090 : Hey, why don't you try to find it before the Musketeers do? I'd rather an adventurer like you have that armor than seeing it turned into a political tool for those idiots in the government.
11091 : I heard that the ones who stole Raogrimm's armor are a group of Goblin thieves that keep their hideout in the Behemoth's Dominion.
11092 : Vana'diel is abuzz with Adventurer Appreciation fever, kupo!
11093 : We moogles have prepared some nice little goodies and gathered lots of top-secret information on adventurer activity, kupo! Let me check my journal for your statistical data...
11094 : Chat Frequency: # Conversations With NPCs: # Parties Joined: # Alliances Joined: #
11095 : Battles Fought: # Number of Times KO'd: # Enemies Defeated: # GM Calls Made: #
11096 : There's your adventuring life in a nutshell!
11097 : There's your adventuring life in a nutshell! And this time, there's an extra-special anniversary present involved! Oh, just be careful you don't accidentally throw it away or anything, because you'll never be able to get another one...ever, kupo!
11098 : Take a look--and to think, you can select # more amazing anniversary items!
11099 : Take a look--and to think, you can select # more amazing anniversary item!
11100 : Which would you like? (# remaining) I need time to think. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
11101 : Ah, I understand. With some many goodies to choose from, it's no surprise that you'd want to think about it a bit more. I'll be here once you've decided, kupo.
11102 : %? (# remaining) Yes. No.
11103 : An excellent choice! I hope you enjoy your brand-new %!
11104 : There's your adventuring life in a nutshell! And because it seems you're so eager to get your hands on some more goodies, I guess I could find it in my heart to spare another...but just for you, kupo!
11105 : You have the choice to either receive your present now, or wait to build up the suspense, kupo!
11106 : If you choose to wait, you might find yourself receiving an even better present, kupo.
11107 : What will you do, kupo? Lemme think, kupo. Gimme my present, kupo! I'll wait, kupo.
11108 : Take all the time you need, and talk to me when you're ready, kupo!
11109 : Here's your present, kupo!
11110 : Kupopopo! A patient one! Let's see how long you can wait before the suspense finally gets to you, kupo!
11111 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
11112 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
11113 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
11114 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
11115 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
11116 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
11117 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
11118 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
11119 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
11120 : You've earned conquest points!
11121 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
11122 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
11123 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
11124 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
11125 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
11126 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
11127 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
11128 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
11129 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
11130 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
11131 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
11132 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
11133 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
11134 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
11135 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
11136 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
11137 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
11138 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
11139 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
11140 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
11141 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
11142 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
11143 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
11144 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
11145 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
11146 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
11147 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
11148 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
11149 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
11150 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
11151 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
11152 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
11153 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
11154 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
11155 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
11156 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
11157 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.

The Vollbow Region (Lv.65). The Elshimo Lowlands Region (Lv.35). The Elshimo Uplands Region (Lv.45). . . . . . . . . . . None.
11159 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
11160 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
11161 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
11162 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
11163 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
11164 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
11165 : Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.
11166 : You currently have # conquest points. Would you like to use them to purchase items?
11167 : Which item do you wish to purchase?

Cancel.
11169 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
11170 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
11171 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.
11172 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 100 conquest points.
11173 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 200 conquest points.
11174 : During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
11175 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.
11176 : Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge % once during the period between each conquest results tally.
11177 : The % is already fully charged.

11192 : Which service do you request? Buy/Sell items. Teleportation. Nothing.
11193 : Do you really wish to be teleported? Yes. Teleport with gil. Teleport with conquest points. No.
11194 : Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!
11195 : It should please you to know that I now also deal in %. Bigger pieces will earn you more points for your nation, and I'll even toss some gil into the equation!
11196 : I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
11197 : I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
11198 : I can teleport you to your home country for # gil or # conquest [point/points].
11199 : Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered.  Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
11200 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
11201 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
11202 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
11203 : I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
11204 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
11205 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points moderately. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
11206 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points greatly. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
11207 : I could not accept one or more items you tried to trade me. Please remove those items and try again.
11208 : Sorry. I can only take certain types of weapons, shields, or armor.

11210 : My apologies, but this type of item needs to be individually appraised. Please trade them to me one at a time.
11211 : (DEBUG) Back to hometown!
11212 : What do you want? Would you cast Signet on me? I'd like to set my home point here. Nothing.
11213 : What do you want? Pay # gil and set my home point here. Nothing.
11214 : Your home point has been set.
11215 : You do not have enough gil to set your home point here.
11216 : I will set your home point here.
11217 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
11218 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
11219 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
11220 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
11221 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
11222 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
11223 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
11224 : Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
11225 : There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
11226 : Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Join the E.F. Not this time.
11227 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
11228 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
11229 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
11230 : One of your party members is below level #. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
11231 : I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
11232 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
11233 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...
11234 : Cancel your participation in the E.F. to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?
11235 : Quit the E.F.? Yes. Change locations. No.
11236 : Are you sure?
11237 : Really quit the E.F.? Yes. No.
11238 : I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
11239 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
11240 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
11241 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
11242 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
11243 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
11244 : You received # conquest points!
11245 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
11246 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
11247 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
11248 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
11249 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
11250 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
11251 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
11252 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
11253 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
11254 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
11255 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
11256 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
11257 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
11258 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
11259 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
11260 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
11261 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
11451 : PAUSE
11453 : Welcome back. How was your battle with the Quadav?
11454 : S-Sir Iron Eater! What brings you to this area?
11455 : So, what is the situation with the Mines District?
11456 : Sir! Nothing out of the ordinary, sir!
11457 : Spare me the textbook answers. That is not what I asked. You know what I speak of... The disappearance of Werei.
11458 : Yes sir! I have heard that he was your mentor, and that he has undertaken his journey of rebirth... My condolences, S-- It is said that he took his life while on his journey of rebirth...
11459 : I did not come here to be told what I already know! I am concerned with the fear of the residents along Ore street.
11460 : Yes sir! My apologies, sir! We will double our efforts to gather any information.
11461 : ...Understood. I apologize for my temper.
11462 : For someone once known as the immovable rock, it is unusual to see him so angered...
11463 : Once a Galka, always a Galka. I guess they have a bond that we Humes will never understand.
11464 : Sir Iron Eater!
11465 : Have you found anything? What is the situation in the Mines District?
11466 : Sir! We continued our investigation into the state of the Galka in the Mines District and found that there is definitely a feeling of unrest among most inhabitants of the area. However, we feel that it has not escalated into a problematic situation.
11467 : Understood...
11468 : I can't believe it. Mister Iron Eater, how can you trust what that Hume is saying?
11469 : Don't you see? You're our only hope! We have no Talekeeper, no dark knight, no Werei to help us work things out... Only you!
11470 : And what about Gumbah? He tries to act as if nothing happened, but I can tell he's really feeling down.
11471 : I see... You and Gumbah may not know this, but Gumbah and Werei were good friends in their former lives.
11472 : Gumbah set out on his journey of rebirth before Werei did, but even with the loss of his memories, something drew him back to this town.
11473 : And so began their strange new relationship. So of course these new developments with Werei cannot be easy for Gumbah.
11474 : I didn't know...
11475 : A mere Musketeer like myself is limited in the things he can do. However, I give you my word I will do anything I can to make things right.
11476 : Werei...set out on his journey of rebirth.
11477 : I'm not upset. I knew it had to happen sooner or later.
11478 : He wasn't feeling that good, but he would always hide it whenever someone would visit.
11479 : I guess he was just worried about the people he would leave behind. He was always like that.
11480 : Come! Take a look at all the wonderful goods from Li'Telor.
11481 : May I interest you in some specialty goods from Vollbow?
11482 : I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Vollbow, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
11483 : So you're the adventurer the guards sent. Let me tell you what I saw...
11484 : What's going on? Why is everyone here?
11485 : Why? Ask our new Talekeeper...
11486 : Our new what!?
11487 : We Galka have been waiting for this boy ever since Raogrimm left us! He is our new Talekeeper!
11488 : I came across him in the Korroloka Tunnel. That is where I heard him recite two hundred years of our memories!
11489 : I can understand everyone being surprised. I too was taken aback when my destiny was made clear to me.
11490 : However, now I realize that I have been chosen to tell the tale of the Galka people. I am the Talekeeper.
11491 : I set out on my journey of rebirth to the far western edge of the Altepa Desert.
11492 : And why did you go there? Only adventurers are allowed clearance into those remote areas.
11493 : In my previous life, I was an adventurer.
11494 : The Talekeeper journeyed to our Galkan homeland for rebirth. At Revelation Rock he heard a voice from the heavens!
11495 : Lead the stray sheep from the land of oppression. That is what I was told. Then the glowing % in my hand unlocked the two hundred years of Galkan memories in my head.
11496 : So...you really are the Talekeeper?
11497 : Do you question the voice from the heavens?
11498 : How are we to know that...
11499 : The Talekeeper speaks only truths.
11500 : He does kind of remind me of Sir Raogrimm...
11501 : Yeah, now that you mention it...
11502 : There is no longer any need to search for Sir Raogrimm, Zeid, or Werei. Our Talekeeper has finally returned!
11503 : Now, is there a place where the Talekeeper may rest? He is exhausted from his journey.
11504 : It is normally off-limits, but I feel we can make an exception and open up the restricted area on Ore Street. Using an inn would only cause commotion among the city residents.
11505 : Very well. Lead us to this restricted area.
11506 : And that is what I saw. To tell you the truth, I'm confused. I should be happy to see the return of the Talekeeper, but something tells me there's more to this story...
11507 : And now there is talk of sending a party to investigate the Altepa Desert, but you should talk to Drake Fang in the Zeruhn Mines about that.
11508 : What is this? You were told by Sir Iron Eater to bring this % back from the Altepa Desert?
11509 : Wait here.
11510 : What is the meaning of this, Tall Mountain?
11511 : Oh, just a personal request. I'd like to see the % that our Talekeeper found when he was on his journey of rebirth.
11512 : The moonpebble is a thing of Altepan legend. It's not every day that one gets to lay their eyes on a Galkan treasure.
11513 : ...
11514 : A-hah-hah. Is that all? Well, normally we wouldn't show it to just anyone, but because you have assisted us so much, I guess we can make an exception.
11515 : I see... Then it was all just...
11516 : What do you see? It was all just what?
11517 : Just a hoax. That is what you meant to say, is it not, Tall Mountain?
11518 : Wh-who are you!?
11519 : I guess I have much more work to do to get the keeper of two hundred years of memories to remember my name.
11520 : What business does a Mythril Musketeer have here? And how dare you call the Talekeeper a fake!
11521 : This adventurer has succeeded in bringing back a real %. And by the looks of it, even a guard could tell that yours was not the true one.
11522 : Not the true one? How do you know that the adventurer's is not a fake? Eh!?
11523 : How could a Hume-tamed dog like you even tell the difference between a simple rock and an authentic Galkan treasure!?
11524 : Are you finished?
11525 : Hello there, Talekeeper!
11526 : Gumbah?
11527 : Wh-who are you?
11528 : I'm Gumbah. I just came by to meet the new Talekeeper.
11529 : Wow. Two hundred years of Galkan memories to carry around. Gee, that must be pretty tough.
11530 : Um...yeah...
11531 : I heard from my friend Werei that Talekeepers, well, don't...
11532 : ...really get to see many birthdays, if you know what I mean.
11533 : !!!
11534 : I don't know if Werei meant that the responsibilities of the title were the reason, or if it was just destiny...
11535 : Now that I think about it, the former Talekeeper, Raogrimm, also disappeared on a mission to the Northlands.
11536 : There's no way you would catch me being a Talekeeper. I don't think I could handle it!
11537 : What is he talking about, Mister Gabbot? You never told me anything about any dangerous missions. You just said if I stuck with you, I could get some delicious grilled mutton!
11538 : Shut your mouth, you imbecile! They're trying to trick you!
11539 : I'm out of here!
11540 : Hey! Wait!
11541 : I would advise a quick departure from this city. And if I, or any of the guards, ever catch you back here again...
11542 : You won't have to worry about that. I just didn't think you would all fall for my story so easily.
11543 : I don't think I made myself clear. Would you like my axe to clear things up for you?
11544 : I-I get the picture!
11545 : I don't know. I thought he had potential...
11546 : It is unusual for you to get so upset, Gumbah.
11547 : Upset? I wasn't upset. But when he said that we didn't need to search for Werei anymore...
11548 : How dare he say such things about my friend.
11549 : Gumbah...
11550 : This...this is a letter from Werei! You say some adventurer had it?
11551 : Why would he do this? He could have just talked to me...
11552 : I apologize for leaving without any notice, but I can assume that you were already aware of my approaching journey.
11553 : Even now as I write this letter, I ponder over whether I should be sending it or not--whether this really is the best thing to do.
11554 : Gumbah. You have always embraced your freedom while turning your cheek to any form of responsibility.
11555 : However, among men who put too much pride in their race, you stand out as a light of reason.
11556 : I know how you must feel. The shock you received when you first realized the weight you must bear...
11557 : The weight the Talekeeper must bear...
11558 : You knew, Werei! And you didn't say anything...
11559 : You thought that after two hundred years of friendship, I wouldn't pick up on something as obvious as that?
11560 : However, I respect your will. You did not choose to bear the anger, pain, and suffering of the Galka people.
11561 : And it is true that those who have been bestowed with this task--including Raogrimm--have always perished before setting out on their journey of rebirth.
11562 : That may be destiny, so I can see why you would be afraid.
11563 : But let me say one thing. You may feel lost, but you must remember, there are things that only you can do.
11564 : Not that the Talekeeper can do, but that only you, Gumbah, can do. Do not forget this as you follow your path in life.
11565 : Only then will you realize why you must carry the two hundred years of Galkan memories.
11566 : I must continue on my journey now. I am looking forward to the day when we can fight again, side by side. Do not forget, we shall always be friends.
11567 : Werei!
11568 : You can come out now, Cornelia. I know you're hiding there.
11569 : So, Gumbah, what are you going to do?
11570 : Do you think I know?
11571 : But I know you, Gumbah, and I know that you aren't going to run away from your destiny, like I have from mine.
11572 : You're different from the rest of us. No matter what you decide, I know that you'll face what lies before you. You're the one who taught me that.
11573 : I'm sorry... I think I just need to be alone...
11574 : Okay, Gumbah...
11575 : Why are only adventurers allowed in the Korroloka Tunnel!? How long must we Galka live in the confines of that cramped Hume-hole!?
11576 : We mineworkers refuse to be tools of the government!
11577 : You only let adventurers pass because there's something down there you don't want us Galka to know about!
11578 : We're sick of being lied to by you Humes!
11579 : H-hey, calm down...okay?
11580 : W-we're just keeping the tunnel closed to protect you...
11581 : Huh!? How long do you think you can fool us!?
11582 : What is going on here!?
11583 : Sir Iron Eater! You must do something. If they would only open this tunnel to us, and not just adventurers, there wouldn't be any problem.
11584 : Do these fools understand what they're saying?
11585 : Oh! It's Gumbah!
11586 : Stop it! All of you!
11587 : When are you going to wake up and realize what you are doing is foolish!?
11588 : What is at the end of the Korroloka Tunnel? You already know! Nothing but desert! Do you still wish to believe that that is where we belong?
11589 : Get out of here, child!
11590 : Big talk for such a little kid! So, what are you saying? You've been there?
11591 : One hundred years ago...I have.
11592 : One hundred years ago!? You've only been around for twenty.
11593 : When Werei and I were still young, we snuck by the guards...
11594 : When we got through to the other side of the tunnel, all we saw was a vast desert and some sandy ruins.
11595 : Is that what you want to call home? Even if you were able to defeat the thousands of Antican warriors, would you really want to live in a place like that?
11596 : But don't you already know the answer? When did the Talekeeper have to start making the decisions for everyone?
11597 : Gumbah...
11598 : Wait... You can't be...
11599 : Let me ask you! Are you willing to go to battle with the Antica just to divert your anger from the Humes?
11600 : Let me ask you! Do you really think that our home lies in that wasteland on the other side of this tunnel?
11601 : Let me ask you! Do we Galka really need a Talekeeper to remember the past?
11602 : Yes, there will be days when conflict will arise between us and the Humes. The world seen through their eyes is much different than the world seen through ours.
11603 : However, the same is true for all Galka. We all look at the world in a different way. No one in this world is exactly alike.
11604 : But there is one thing that can be said, and that is that we are all living together on this planet, Vana'diel. There is nothing that can change that.
11605 : Of course people are going to have different morals and ideals, but we all must learn to live together. There is only one Vana'diel!
11606 : The Galka future does not lie out in a desert. Bastok is our home!
11607 : Raogrimm, Werei, Zeid...they are all gone. However, we no longer need a Talekeeper to remember our past. We can do it ourselves--together.
11608 : There is no reason for any of you to rely on a kid who had the rotten luck of getting stuck with two hundred years of memories.
11609 : However, if it will help, I will try to do anything that I can--even if it means keeping two centuries of memories.
11610 : If that will show you that you don't need a Talekeeper to live happy lives...
11611 : Gumbah...
11612 : Ha ha. It's been a while since I talked like an adult. It's pretty draining.
11613 : Now you can rest in peace...Werei...Raogrimm...
11614 : Everybody still looks a little confused. They don't even know how to talk to me.
11615 : Well, I don't blame them. The Talekeeper is supposed to be a great, sacred presence. I was probably the last person they'd expect to be the Talekeeper.
11616 : But that's okay. They can think of me the way they always have--as an annoying little kid.
11617 : I'm not going to treat him any different just because he's the Talekeeper. It must have been hard for him to keep it all inside like he did...
11618 : But on the inside, he's still just the jerk that I've known all along! He's not getting any special treatment from me!
11619 : I get it now! He was always talking like he was the best because he was the Talekeeper! Hah! Talekeepers--who needs 'em!
11620 : I guess we can no longer live by those words anymore...but I never thought that it would be Gumbah who would teach us that.
11621 : There has been some commotion in the Mines District near Ore Street. People are saying that a new Talekeeper has appeared.
11622 : It sounds fishy to me, but with the disappearance of their elder, Werei, anything could be possible. And the last thing we want is an uprising by the Galka.
11623 : Go to Ore Street and talk to Medicine Eagle. He says he was there when the commotion started.
11624 : I assume an adventurer of your caliber has heard of Norg.
11625 : Well, the place is a haven for pirates. They even have ties with the Tenshodo. In any case, it's an area that cannot be looked upon lightly.
11626 : That is why we want you to travel there as an emissary. Report to Sir Naji in the President's Office for details.
11627 : Currently, Chief Engineer Cid is conducting research on the architecture in Ro'Maeve near the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. Your next mission is to travel there and assist him.
11628 : Report to the Chief Engineer in the Metalworks for further details.
11629 : We are searching for an adventurer holding vital information dealing with a certain national investigation.
11630 : The president himself has expressed great interest in this case. Proceed to the President's Office for the details of this mission.
11631 : You've been ordered by the president to deliver that %. When you have completed that task, you can return here for your next mission.
11632 : It looks like Bastok is really going to begin an investigation of the Galka homeland of Altepa.
11633 : Your role in this investigation will have you traveling to the Quicksand Caves. Get the details of this mission from Iron Eater in the President's Office.
11634 : As a continuation of Bastok's investigation of Altepa, this time you will be traveling to Zepwell Island.
11635 : You will be carrying out your part of the investigation in the Kuftal Tunnel, which connects Cape Teriggan to Zepwell Island. Report to Drake Fang in the Zeruhn Mines for details.
11636 : Senator Alois has asked for your assistance.
11637 : It is something about an expedition to Vollbow...
11638 : I just hope he's not asking you to go get lizard eggs again... Wait, you didn't hear me say that.
11639 : Recently, an adventurer who was sent to investigate the Northlands has been attacked.
11640 : According to her report, the attacker resembled the dark knight Zeid.
11641 : The strange thing is that the attacker passed a letter to the adventurer before letting her go. Now, this letter's content is causing quite a commotion in the President's Office.
11642 : You have been asked to report directly to President Karst for further details.
11643 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
11644 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.
11645 : Now close your eyes...

11651 : Would you be interested in a nice suit of adventurer-issue armor? Be careful when you buy, though. We offer no refunds.
11652 : I got no business with a flea like you. Get outta my face before I decide to messy-wess you up.
11653 : You're %, right? Ha ha ha! I knew it! Just like Gilgamesh described. Lemme tell you what I gotty-wot so far.
11654 : The creepy-weep that stole our helmet isn't from any large syndicate. He isn't even very famous among other pirates. He's just a simple thiefy-weef trying to pull off a big job for a big profit.
11655 : According to the owner of that inn, he traveled numerous timey-wimes between here and Selbina, and would sometimes talk about his plans after a few too many drinky-winks. But then one day, he just disappeared.
11656 : After looking at Norg's nautical loggy-wogs, I learned that the time he disappeared matches the time he must have entered our headquarters. But where he went from therey-where, I don't know.
11657 : Wa-wa-wait! There's something else.
11658 : One of our men in Bastok is piecing together all the information we've gathered so far. He's hiding out in a run-down old housey-wouse in the Mines District (J-6). He should be able to give you something juicy-wuicy.
11659 : I thought that this might have been the work of some large groupy-woop, but when I heard that it was just one guy...boy, was I surprisey-wised!
11660 : I can understand wanting to makey-wake it big overnight, but he should have thought a little bitty-wit longer before deciding to take us on!
11661 : Would you mind leaving me alone? I have no time for small talk.
11662 : You are %, are you not? I have been waiting for your arrival. I do not have much time, so I will keep this quick.
11663 : The day of the theft, there were numerous reports of a strange character wearing an even stranger helmet traveling on foot towards Zulkheim.
11664 : I journeyed here from San d'Oria, but heard nothing of such sightings on my way. This leaves the possibility that he may have turned back to Jeuno.
11665 : I feel that he may still be in the area. I am going to continue my search here.
11666 : And one other thing.
11667 : One more of us is stationed in a small, run-down building in the Bastok Mines (J-6). He may have some useful information.
11668 : The type of helmet that was stolen is known in the Far East as a kabuto. Many people find its design strange, but I find it quite interesting.
11669 : You're finally here, %.
11670 : I've heard of you from my associates in Norg. As much as I would like to sit and chat with you about your adventures, we must work quickly to find our thief. I have just received a new piece of information and will be setting out shortly to investigate.
11671 : To the northeast of here is a place called the Palborough Mines. I've received information on several adventurers sighting a young man wearing a strangely shaped helmet journeying deep into those caves.
11672 : This is more than likely the same character that Sanosuke learned of in Jeuno. But why would he head to the Palborough Mines? I'm heading there myself to find out.
11673 : I have heard that the Quadav made that place into one of their strongholds. I wonder if there could be some connection...
11674 : You may journey to the mines with me if you wish. When you have made your preparations, meet me there. I will be waiting.
11675 : I-it's you...
11676 : We're too...late. He's already...passed through the...portal. The seal...on the helmet...won't hold much...longer.
11677 : Unless you want to end up...like me, don't...touch the burning circle. It's protected...by a powerful curse.
11678 : Hurry...back to Norg and tell...them what's happened. Get something to...break the curse...keep the demon...from escaping...
11679 : .........
11680 : He has lost consciousness.
11681 : The time has come for me to rise again... I am no longer bound by the chains that annoying Hume forced upon me...
11682 : Many a night I wasted away, rotting in the darkness of my prison...
11683 : Gnyah-hah-hah! But Humes are a frail species. They grow old and wither away. The one who sent me to my hell is no more...
11684 : Now there are none who can stand in my way!
11685 : What is this? I sense someone approaching... Someone with the same power as that Hume...
11686 : You did it!
11687 : The seal was broken, but thanks to you, the demon has been put to rest.
11688 : Our ancestors' % has been damaged, but its tattered appearance is proof of the evil sprit's demise. Take this back to Norg and inform them of your deeds.
11689 : Much of the cursed seal still remains. I will remain here and attempt to clear the rest of it away. Until we meet again, %!
11690 : The % has been badly damaged... You obtain %.
11691 : The % you carry has lost its effectiveness. You may dispose of it now.
11692 : You've cleared Samurai AF 2!
11693 : You don't have %!
11694 : Press any button to continue (probably the confirmation one, though).
11695 : Trick or treat...
11696 : Thank you... And now for your treat...
11697 : Here, take this...
11698 : If you put this on and walk around, something...unexpected might happen...
11699 : Thank you...
11700 : If two people with the same costumes form a party and approach a bomb balloon, then...
11701 : Perfect timing, %! I just received a letter from Zeid.
11702 : It says, Do not let Werei's technique fade. Grant his blade unto those who are worthy.
11703 : Hmmm, I wonder if he means the sword Werei forgot to take with him on his journey... Anyway, you look pretty strong. Would you mind trying this out? If you come across anything strange, bring it back to me, and I'll have a look at it.
11704 : What's wrong? You didn't go and lose the sword now, did you?
11705 : Why are you here? No particular reason. I went and lost the sword... I'm tired of this.
11706 : You know, I knew you were going to say that. The sword you lost was delivered to my room earlier today. Here, take it.
11707 : What? You're not serious, are you?
11708 : Are you serious? Dead serious. I was just bluffing.
11709 : Oh well, you can keep the sword. Werei left a chest full of these things, and I'm running out of room to store them...
11710 : Hm? It doesn't look like anything special has happened yet... Maybe you should use it a little bit longer.
11711 : Perfect timing, %! I just got another letter from Zeid. He said to give you this if there were any changes in the sword.
11712 : He also wanted me to tell you this: You will acquire Werei's hidden technique only after you've traveled to the Western Altepa Desert and retrieved the %. Hmph. If this is so important, why couldn't he just come here and give it to you himself?
11713 : You're back already? Well, let's see what you brought back.
11714 : Wait a minute... This isn't Werei's technique...
11715 : Oh, I see... That's what Zeid was trying to say.
11716 : I remember Werei telling me that long ago, the dark knight, Zeid, challenged him to a duel.
11717 : Zeid was still young and couldn't match the experience of the elder Werei. However, from his defeat, Zeid was able to devise a powerful new technique.
11718 : It was this head-on collision of these two different styles of battle--no, these two different paths in life--from which this new skill was born.
11719 : Werei wanted Zeid to realize that it was not only training, but also the crossing of different paths that made a man strong... Even if those paths were never meant to cross again...
11720 : You know, %. The battles you have fought have probably already taught you some new techniques as well. Use them wisely! Use them wisely!

11738 : % and % cannot be used here.
11739 : %... Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to. The time left to me is short.
11740 : Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...
11741 : I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me... It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...
11742 : Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.
11743 : A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.
11744 : My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully. Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.
11745 : Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world. You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete. My hopes go with you, %.
11746 : There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.
11747 : There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.
11748 : The strands of grass here have been tied together.
11749 : There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.
11750 : I see you have met with Raogrimm. His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.
11751 : In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.
11752 : You will need the %, a key that bridges the void between Vana'diel and that other world.
11753 : It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The % is one of those items.
11754 : You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the %. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...
11755 : That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.
11756 : Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.
11757 : The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.
11758 : We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.
11759 : Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the % to guide you...
11760 : I never believed that my indifference to the state of other nations would cause harm to my beloved San d'Oria...
11761 : As part of my penance, I will infuse the % with what guidance I can.
11762 : I betrayed him... And now I am needed, the one who cut down poor Cornelia. The man cursed with the brand of traitor...
11763 : Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...
11764 : I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
11765 : Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.
11766 : Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord... This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.
11767 : Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
11768 : Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.
11769 : I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.
11770 : Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.
11771 : Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this %! Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
11772 : There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.
11773 : There is a symbol carved into the rock here.
11774 : I have been waiting for you.
11775 : Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"... Do you understand the significance of these words?
11776 : When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form... Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.
11777 : Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...
11778 : The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.
11779 : Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard.  The next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.
11780 : You must obtain the last trophy. All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.
11781 : Take care, my brave adventurer. May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
11782 : Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning. This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.
11783 : I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death. Is this what they call karma...?
11784 : This land has borne the weight of my sins. I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...
11785 : So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed... Keep your wits aboutaru you, %.
11786 : I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes. Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.
11787 : It is time! Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, %. %! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
11788 : Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a prison of souls.
11789 : Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened. Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...
11790 : It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?
11791 : There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.
11792 : Please pay no mind to my ramblings. You have secured the %. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.
11793 : You will need four such trophies. Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.
11794 : I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...
11795 : Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.
11796 : It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities. If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...
11797 : %. This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.
11798 : When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there. That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.
11799 : What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge. But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...
11800 : That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...
11801 : Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry! I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.
11802 : Now, %. This % is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.
11803 : Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, %. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...
11804 : The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.
11805 : I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.
11806 : Wait, wait, wait! I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but... How can I explain it?
11807 : Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.
11808 : But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order! You've got your paws on the %! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.
11809 : But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.
11810 : % and the four trophies. These artifacts have long been lost to that other world.  The Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.
11811 : It must have been in the time of the Great War... Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.
11812 : Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.
11813 : The % and the %. Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms. Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...
11814 : Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way. However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...
11815 : Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...
11816 : Is it over...?
11817 : No, the rage has merely been dispersed.
11818 : As long as I exist, he will never truly die...
11819 : Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?
11820 : %... You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented. I have not the words to express my gratitude.
11821 : The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more. I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...
11822 : The one who holds sway...?
11823 : Yes. From the center of infinite darkness. I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...
11824 : You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell. The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.
11825 : It was an error in judgment to shelter you... The order of my realm has been disrupted.
11826 : I give to you a duty... You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.
11827 : No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul. No return to the land of blessed light...
11828 : What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness? As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.
11829 : Of one thing I was certain. This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.
11830 : A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.
11831 : Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow. It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.
11832 : Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey. Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.
11833 : %, you may be the one to witness this truth.
11834 : The power stored in the % will soon be drained. And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.
11835 : Do not forget who you are, %. I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.
11836 : My old companions...?
11837 : This duty is too much for just one to bear. If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived. It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.
11838 : That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.
11839 : Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis? I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.
11840 : Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm. I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.
11841 : C'mon, let's see a little excitement! This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.
11842 : It's not the Northlands this time. None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?
11843 : I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain. Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.
11844 : I thought this would be the end of you for sure... Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.
11845 : What, no words for an old friend? Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?
11846 : I betrayed you! I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia! The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!
11847 : Everything began thirty years ago. And there were things that came to an end... Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.
11848 : And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.
11849 : I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions. No matter who that person may be.
11850 : Raogrimm...
11851 : Are you sure you want to do this? This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land. As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...
11852 : Raogrimm. There is no need to suffer alone anymore. Our presence here should answer your question.
11853 : There are crimes that must be atoned for. And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.
11854 : Until the dawn of an age without hatred... No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.
11855 : Cornelia...
11858 : There is a strange symbol drawn here. A haunting chill sweeps through you as you gaze upon it...
11859 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: Present the %...if you wish to pass into...my dream.
11860 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: The sands of time yet fall... Present the...%.
11861 : I am the ruler of Dynamis.
11862 : Are you lost? Or are you here by your own reckless designs? Either way, this is not your dream.
11863 : The dreamer of this realm is a separate entity than he who dreamt of that wasteland of malice, Xarcabard.
11864 : Who would dare bring a new dream into my world of Dynamis?
11865 : I divided my form in order to find the answer, but my counterpart has yet to return to me.
11866 : While wandering through this realm, you may come across another semblance of myself.
11867 : The memory of our encounter will become a guide to my shadow as it wanders this dream.
11868 : Search for my counterpart, and unite this realm with your own dream.
11869 : A nightmare curses this land yet again.
11870 : Take heed, dream traveler.
11871 : I have been watching your dream.
11872 : But you cannot grasp the identity of this realm's dreamer from there. This land will continue to devour its way into Dynamis.
11873 : You must find my counterpart and crush the dreamer of this realm.
11874 : I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...
11875 : The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.
11876 : Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place... The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.
11877 : The entrance to the dream has already been opened. Find and destroy the source if you wish to protect my realm.
11878 : I am...a unique entity...
11879 : We are...comprised of all entities...
11880 : Intermingling with one another...dividing among each other...
11881 : And devouring one another...
11882 : The shadow that you defeated had been consumed by the dreamer of this realm.
11883 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who have come into contact with the Emptiness.
11884 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who came into contact with the Emptiness.
11885 : Could it have been that girl...? When I next see her, she will pay dearly.
11886 : Could it have been that girl...? No, there was one more, transformed after death...
11887 : Her malice will not perish as long as this dream continues, using my shadows to revive countless times.
11888 : You must confront the nightmare and continue to fight them to keep this realm from spreading.
11889 : The dreamer is not the girl who once harbored the Emptiness... Could it have been transferred to another girl...?
11890 : You know this girl well. I could take care of her easily, but if you wish me to spare her, then you will lend me your power.
11891 : Trade the % to the Hieroglyphics found in each area. The % will be transformed into %.
11892 : From that point on, one of the areas of Dynamis will be reserved by the bearer of the %. The destination and time to be spent in Dynamis will be recorded in the help text of the %.

11931 : When you've gathered a First 3 combination, bring the eggs back to me! Also, if you want, I can trade you more initial eggs, but you'll have to make it worth my while, kupo!
11932 : Well, that's it for my anniversary egg-splanation. Happy hunting, kupo!
11933 : Egg-cellent! Here's your prize, kupo! Now if only somebody would bring me a super combo... Oh, egg-scuse me! Forget I said that, kupo!

11939 : Ku-kupo! Such an egg-stravagant item, for little old me? Here's a whole basketful of initial eggs for you, kupo!

11950 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
11951 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
11952 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
11953 : You're not wearing your yukata! Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!
11954 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
11955 : Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!
11956 : Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage! When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!
11957 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
11958 : Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
11959 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
11960 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
11961 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
11962 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
11963 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
11964 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
11965 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
11966 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
11967 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
11968 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
11969 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
11970 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
11971 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
11972 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
11973 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
11974 : You can only carry one %.
11975 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
11976 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
11977 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
11978 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
11979 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
11980 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
11981 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
11982 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
11983 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
11984 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
11985 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
11986 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
11987 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
11988 : If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...

12032 : <Match #> Entry period begins:  Briefing begins:
12033 : I apologize, but your level is too low to participate in an official Brenner match.
12034 : Official matches are scheduled to begin at the following times: Match 1: # Match 2:  Match 3:
12035 : Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of # gil is required before each match.
12036 : Travel to the Isle? Yes. Not yet.
12037 : What would you like to know about? Basic rules. Official/private matches. Flammen-Brenner. Flamme. Match score. Petras and quarrying. Sprint. KO. Return.
12038 : The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:
12039 : First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of Flammen-Brenner.
12040 : At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with Flamme, or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.
12041 : Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.
12042 : The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.
12043 : The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.
12044 : If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The match score section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
12045 : Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
12046 : You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
12047 : No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
12048 : The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed # members, or if there are fewer than # members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
12049 : Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
12050 : LS Liga is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
12051 : A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
12052 : The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
12053 : If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
12054 : After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
12055 : Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
12056 : In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
12057 : Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
12058 : Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
12059 : However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
12060 : Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
12061 : Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
12062 : The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
12063 : In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
12064 : In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
12065 : I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?
12066 : What's this? You say you found my old name tag?
12067 : <Puff...huff...> Just a...moment...adventurer...
12068 : What's the meaning of desertifying me like that?
12069 : If we don't show the tag to Pavuluke, we can't make progress in our investimigation!
12070 : Mister Pavalake! Please take a look at this!
12071 : My name is Pavvke... But more importantly, where did you find this?
12072 : Yes, yes, Pavvke, that's what I said. This tag was discoverified in the Moblin settlement that recently appeared in North Gustaberg.
12073 : The nomadic town of Movalpolos... Back again, huh?
12074 : Mo...val...po...los?
12075 : Yes, the Moblins carry this city with them as they tunnel through the earth.
12076 : Almost a hundred years ago, our expansion of the Gusgen Mines ran into the tunnels being dug by the Moblins.
12077 : What!? Why was I never informarized about this!?
12078 : At the time, Bastok was involved with the elimination of Mithran pirates terrorizing the southern seas.
12079 : Hume officials probably know next to nothing about our battle with Movalpolos.
12080 : You must be speaking of the Elshimo Campaign. Windurst was falsely accuserized by the governments of Bastok and Tavnazia...
12081 : ...Did you just mentionify a battle with the inhabitants of Movalpolos?
12082 : Are you telling us that the Moblins started warification on you?
12083 : Hmm. The Moblins retreated into their city and only emerged to kidnap people and steal books.
12084 : However, they weren't attacking us as such. Even the people who were kidnapped were returned unharmed.
12085 : Then one Galka decided he would learn the Moblin language and try to reason with them.
12086 : But his attempts ended in failure... The Moblins suddenly became hostile and dangerous.
12087 : What a calamity! What kind of words were exchangified, I wonder!?
12088 : I supposify Galka aren't known for their diplomacy...
12089 : Nobody really knows what passed between them. In any case, the battle ended as abruptly as it had begun.
12090 : One morning, we awoke to discover that the tunnel connecting the mines to Movalpolos had completely caved in. The Moblins had left.
12091 : So they fled, thinking they would be obliteraficated?
12092 : I don't think so. Bastok had no formal army. It had come to the point where we had even considered collapsing the Gusgen Mines.
12093 : Then, perhaps they had achieverized some goal?
12094 : I don't know. The only person who knows what really happened back then would be Jabbos, the Galka who tried talking with the Moblins.
12095 : And where can this Galka be locatified?
12096 : Nobody knows. He disappeared on the first day of our battle with Movalpolos.
12097 : I guess he was ashamed at the trouble he had caused.
12098 : He ran away? That doesn't seem very Galka-ized to me.
12099 : ...
12100 : Well, don't despairify, Mister Pakuke!
12101 : Rhinostery researchers from the Federation of Windurst are dispatchimicated to every corner of Vana'diel. We'll locatify him for you!
12102 : This is a great development! Now we know that communification can take place with the Moblins if we manage to learn their language!
12103 : I must reportificate to Mythril Musketeer Ayame and delay the deployerization of the troops.
12104 : Here's your remunerafication.  Take care, bye bye now!
12105 : I am Virnage, a friar from the San d'Orian Cathedral. Coming to Bastok is part of my pilgrimage.
12106 : I was permitted to peruse the holy tome that was found in the Moblin lair below North Gustaberg.
12107 : It is, without a doubt, a volume printed by the San d'Orian Cathedral. Judging by its relatively unsullied condition, the book appears to have been handled with care and reverence.
12108 : If these Moblins truly believe in the grace of the Goddess Altana, I cannot abandon them to the ungentle ministrations of the Republic.
12109 : However, it would be foolish of me to venture alone into a beastman lair without further confirmation of their faith.
12110 : Would you be willing to discover the truth behind this theological enigma?
12111 : Are you willing to discover the truth? Ready and able. I can't handle the truth.
12112 : My most humble thanks. ...This is a talisman bearing the symbol of the Goddess.
12113 : The same symbol adorns the cover of the holy tome. Presenting the talisman to the Moblins should help you determine where their true faith lies.
12114 : The % bears the same symbol that adorns the book of worship. Presenting this to the Moblins should help you determine where their true faith lies.
12115 : How did you fare? Was the talisman well-received?
12116 : Great Goddess! You were attacked!?
12117 : Were my hopes in vain?  Though they did not ally themselves with the Shadow Lord, these Moblins do live in a world without the blessing of light.
12118 : I must conclude that the careful treatment of the holy tome had more to do with its value as a curiosity, rather than as an object of faith.
12119 : However, the symbol of the Dawn Goddess in your possession assured you safe passage back to the surface world. Do you not agree?
12120 : What say you? I will make you a gift of the talisman in return for a small donation to the cathedral...
12121 : Hm? You say the talisman was taken by a Galka that spoke the Moblin tongue?
12122 : And he disappeared into the depths of Movalpolos after saving you from the enraged Moblins?
12123 : Hm? You say the talisman was taken by a Moblin that spoke the common tongue?
12124 : And he mentioned a Galka had taught him how to speak our language?
12125 : This Galka must be a person of some importance in the Moblin city.
12126 : Perhaps he was the original owner of the holy tome you retrieved.
12127 : We must report the existence of this Galka to Ayame of the Mythril Musketeers.
12128 : If these beastmen are capable of living alongside people, we cannot simply brand them as villains...
12129 : Please accept your reward. May Paradise open its gates to you.
12130 : I was thinking this out loud when an Elvaan girl passing by stopped to talk to me.
12131 : But what about moogles? They've got wings, and they can fly, but you wouldn't call 'em birds. They've got those funny antennae, too, but they're not insects, either.
12132 : When I responded to her remark with the fact that both moogles and chocobos are animals, this is what she asked:
12133 : Then what's the difference between animals and people?
12134 : I answered, People are smarter than animals. And then she retorted, People sure are more sly!
12135 : Ahahaha, don't get all huffy on me! I stopped to talk because what you were saying was important.
12136 : People are all different from one another. They're different from animals, and different from plants. This difference is what makes it all worth it.
12137 : There are lots of ways to think and feel, and things to know and to believe. But in the end, we all come from the same source.
12138 : That's true for both people and animals.
12139 : We all have this thing called a soul. The souls of animals are pure and simple.
12140 : Look over there. That chocobo is living proof.
12141 : You should ask someone how that chocobo was born. Then you'll have your answers.
12142 : ...And then she went on her way.
12143 : I went to find out how that chocobo was born, but no one could tell me.
12144 : Shalott said the chocobo's mother was from the stables in Bastok.
12145 : She said it was a special chocobo that had silver-colored feathers on its neck.
12146 : How I wish I could go to Bastok to see her for myself.
12147 : I wonder if that Elvaan girl will be passing by again anytime soon...
12148 : That Elvaan girl told me that both people and animals have souls. She said that the souls of animals are far more pure than those of people.
12149 : She also told me I would understand what she meant if I found out how that chocobo was born.
12150 : According to Shalott, the chocobo's mother is from the stables in Bastok. How I wish I could go there to see her for myself...
12151 : What can I do for you? If you want to ride a chocobo, one of the girls over there can help you out.
12152 : Lately, a lot of adventurers seem to be forgetting that a chocobo is an animal, not an object.
12153 : You should keep that in mind as you're enjoying that easy ride through monster-ridden badlands. Have a safe journey.
12154 : A chocobo with silver-colored feathers...?
12155 : Ah, you'd be talking about Silver Comet.
12156 : She used to be the mount of a highly ranked general in the Bastokan navy.
12157 : The general's son received the chocobo as a coming-of-age present, which he promptly took advantage of to leave Bastok.
12158 : For the longest time, no one saw hide nor hair of man or beast--until eventually, Silver Comet came wandering back into town...alone.
12159 : I heard later on that the general's son had lost his life somewhere in the wilds.
12160 : Only Silver Comet had managed to return unharmed.
12161 : In memory of his son, the general asked us to take the chocobo into our care...
12162 : But then one day, Silver Comet was gone. Some chocobo thief had stolen her.
12163 : Hm? You say a chick of Silver Comet's is being kept in the Jeuno stables? You must be mistaken.
12164 : Anyway, after the theft, the general exhausted every avenue in search of his son's chocobo.
12165 : He eventually found an adventurer who allegedly saw a chocobo drowning in the Pashhow Marshlands.
12166 : That chocobo had the same markings as Silver Comet.
12167 : If you want to try talking to that adventurer, you should go to the outpost in the marshlands.
12168 : He's given up the adventuring life, it seems. Now he earns his daily bread by seeing to the needs of the soldiers at the outpost.
12169 : The gate is locked.
12170 : Whaddaya want? I got no time for adventurers.
12171 : Huh? Where'd you hear... Well, whatever.
12172 : You say you got business with me?
12173 : Silver Comet... What the hell are you bothering me about that old chocobo story for? You some kind of crackpot?
12174 : Leave me alone, you loon.
12175 : Can't you see I'm busy?  This place gets too wet and too dark too quick to be wasting time chatting.
12176 : Hold up a minute. If you bring me some %, I might be willing to give you the time of day.
12177 : Yep, three of those ought to do it. I'll give you until the day after tomorrow.
12178 : You brought what I asked for? Careful with that stuff, it's powerful smelly.
12179 : It's good for hiding a person's scent, you see. Helps me get around.
12180 : Now, then. You wanted to hear about that chocobo, right?
12181 : She was one of the fastest chocobos I've ever ridden, but damn near uncontrollable. I don't know how Silver Comet's owner handled her.
12182 : I guess the death of her former owner is what sent her off the edge. That chocobo wasn't right in the head.
12183 : She threw herself headlong into the marshes. Thought my number was up, I can tell you!
12184 : When I saw her in the stables, she was wearing a collar attached to a chain.
12185 : That wasn't to keep the general's mount from being stolen--it was to keep Silver Comet from flying the coop, so to speak.
12186 : That general's a real schemer. Said that if Silver Comet was released, she would be able to find Shooting Star.
12187 : It's his fault I almost got killed!
12188 : Huh? Who's Shooting Star? He's a chocobo, too.
12189 : Shooting Star was Silver Comet's mate.
12190 : Their love was a pure, uncomplicated thing, much more so than what people feel.
12191 : Ahahaha! I think this oil is starting to muddle my senses. I'll see you around, adventurer.
12192 : Were you able to meet with that adventurer?
12193 : ...Is that right? I think you were around that % a bit too long.
12194 : It sounds to me like that adventurer was the one who stole Silver Comet in the first place.
12195 : Or at least you would think so, if the thief wasn't supposed to have drowned in the marsh as well.
12196 : You mentioned a Shooting Star? I know that name.
12197 : That chocobo was raised alongside Silver Comet. Those two were almost inseparable as chicks.
12198 : Unfortunately, unlike Silver Comet's case, Shooting Star died saving his master.
12199 : I'm guessing Silver Comet was trying to find him when she jumped into that marsh. The general mentioned something similar at the time, I recall.
12200 : Hm? Still trying to convince me that her chick is in Jeuno?
12201 : I'm sorry, but I really think you're mistaken. I mean, the general even had Silver Comet's collar.
12202 : He said he was going to lay it on his son's grave in Batallia Downs.
12203 : But, wait. I seem to remember that collar being sent by a man named Brutus. He runs a chocobo stable in Jeuno...
12204 : Why would the collar be sent from Jeuno when Silver Comet drowned in the Pashhow Marshlands?
12205 : You are being attacked!
12206 : Now is not the time for that!
12207 : You sense something is not quite right...
12208 : You find nothing.
12209 : I...I don't know what you're talking about.
12210 : Wow... So this collar belonged to that chocobo's mother, Silver Comet?
12211 : I would place this on the grave of her mate, Shooting Star, if I only knew where it was.
12212 : So you're the two snoopers who were asking Shalott about Silver Comet.
12213 : That collar...!?
12214 : You've dug pretty far into this old story. Looks like after twenty years, people start to let things slip.
12215 : Please don't be angry, Brutus.
12216 : I found out that chocobos can fall in love, just like people do.
12217 : There was a girl who taught me that animals and people are the same.
12218 : I think the story of Silver Comet and Shooting Star helped me to really understand what she meant.
12219 : Well then, I suppose I'll have to tell you the whole tale.
12220 : Silver Comet and Shooting Star never really died.
12221 : Really!?
12222 : Shooting Star was a special chocobo that was attacked by an evil man.
12223 : He was badly wounded when they brought him here, and we all worked hard to get him back on his feet.
12224 : But Shooting Star was still being chased by the evil man, so we had to hide him away.
12225 : We took him to a place in the west of Batallia Downs, where that villain would never find him.
12226 : But the bad man was clever. He knew that if he had Silver Comet, her bond to Shooting Star would lead them right to the chocobo's hiding place.
12227 : Silver Comet was one smart chocobo, though.
12228 : She deliberately dove into the marshes to force the villain from her back.
12229 : It was an extremely dangerous thing for Silver Comet to do.
12230 : But she never gave up. She had to protect her mate from the man who meant to hurt him.
12231 : Silver Comet swam through the muck and dragged herself free of the marshlands. She was finally able to make it to Shooting Star's side.
12232 : That's when I took off her collar and set her free.
12233 : What happened to them after that?
12234 : Did they live happily ever after?
12235 : That's right. And the youngest of the brood they raised together is that chocobo right over there.
12236 : What a great story...
12237 : It's not over yet. The villain of this tale is still lurking around somewhere.
12238 : That's why you can never tell anybody what you've heard here today.  You want to keep that chocobo safe, right?
12239 : Right!
12240 : I'll never tell, I promise!
12241 : Glad to hear it. And one more thing...
12242 : Don't forget how Silver Comet never gave up on her mate.
12243 : Even when those they love and believe in have gone, animals will keep on striving.
12244 : Right. That's because animals come from the same source as people.
12245 : Adventurer, you can have this. Keep this story to yourself.
12246 : Thank you so much! And this is from me.
12247 : I wonder if that Elvaan girl knows how Silver Comet and Shooting Star were married.
12248 : I would like to meet her again some day...
12249 : Press any button to continue.
12250 : I'd like to start my own business someday, but I just haven't found anything that truly interests me.
12251 : Rare Tavnazian imports! Get them before they're gone!
12252 : I'd love to sell you goods imported from the island of Tavnazia, but with the area under foreign control, I can't secure my trade routes...
12253 : Hey! You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right? Take this letter to that [cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?
12254 : Excuse me, [mister/lady]. Would you take this letter to the [guy/lady] in the red hat?
12255 : Adventurer-[man/lady]! Could you take this letter to that funny [guy/lady] in the red hat?
12256 : I would like to take this letter to a certain [fellow/woman] wearing a red chapeaux; however, my parents do not allow me to stray far from home. Kind adventurer, might you deliver it in my stead?
12257 : Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
12258 : Whoa! Thanks, [misterrr/lady]!
12259 : Thank you so very much, [sir/ma'am]!
12260 : Another present? Sorry, but I only have two hands, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer!
12261 : Wow! Another present! Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?
12262 : Hey, didn't you just give me a prrresent? You're starrrting to scare me, [mister/lady]...
12263 : I just accepted a gift from you, kind [sir/ma'am]. I could not possibly accept another.
12264 : ou've brought joy to the children of Vana'diel!
12265 : ou've brought barrelfuls of joy to the children of Vana'diel!
12266 : ##
12267 : Hi there! I'm a smilebringer! I've come from a faraway land to the north to bring joy and happiness to the children of Vana'diel! You look a little old for presents, though.
12268 : Here, take this and give it to a child. Not only will it make her feel better, but you'll feel better, too!
12269 : Trust me!
12270 : They say you can't buy happiness with money...but you can get pretty close!
12271 : What? Letters? They must be from the impoverished republican tykes!
12272 : Wait a minute... There is no name on this %. I wonder who wrote it...
12273 : Who is it from? Arawn. Dehlner. Emrys. Folzen. Gwill. Patricius. Remus. Rothais. Vaghron. Valeri.
12274 : Are you positive that [Arawn/Dehlner/Emrys/Folzen/Gwill/Patricius/Remus/Rothais/Vaghron/Valeri], [Arawn/Dehlner/Emrys/Folzen/Gwill/Patricius/Remus/Rothais/Vaghron/Valeri], and [Arawn/Dehlner/Emrys/Folzen/Gwill/Patricius/Remus/Rothais/Vaghron/Valeri] were the ones who gave you the letters?
12275 : Well? Positive! Wait a minute...
12276 : Hm... Without any name, I'll never know who sent this %...
12277 : Well, I'll be! You see, this just proves my theory: You only get what you give!
12278 : Wait... Was that a twinkle I just saw in your eye? Don't tell me... You'd like to help bring joy and happiness to the children of Vana'diel!
12279 : I knew it! Well, if you're going to join our ranks, you'll have to play the part. Here, take this hat. You could call it our official smilebringer uniform. Without it, you're just another average Joe.
12280 : Well, I'll be! It's stuff like this that makes it all worthwhile.
12281 : Bastok's trees are the best in Vana'diel, and don't let anybody tell you they're not--especially those fruity Moogles in San d'Oria, kupo!
12282 : Bastok's trees are the best in Vana'diel because we use nothing but the best materials! Now take this and hurry back to the craftsman before he has both our heads, kupo!
12283 : I told you to hurry, kupo!
12284 : Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?
12285 : Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!
12286 : You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.
12287 : This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.
12288 : But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!
12289 : It's just not fair, kupo!
12290 : Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!
12291 : And that's why we need your help, kupo! Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?
12292 : There is a variety of different sets. For each set you bring back safely, I'll secretly give you the present that we were going to give the Goblins, kupo!
12293 : For starters, why don't you try finding %, %, and %? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!
12294 : Great! A whole set, kupo! Ah, I wish I could be there to see the look on those Gobs' faces when all they find is an empty hole. Oh, right! Here's your reward, kupo!
12295 : If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo! We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!
12296 : Wow! Another set! You don't know how much this means to us, kupo! Here, take this!
12297 : Have you seen the decorations? The Doll Festival has started, kupo!
12298 : I heard from my moogle sources that this is a celebration for the health and happiness of girls, kupo.
12299 : Apparently, the young lady and her beau would play empress and emperor, and would be joined by eight of their friends for the festivities, kupo.
12300 : Why don't you try making a ten-person party as well? We can all have fun celebrating the Doll Festival, kupo!
12301 : It looks like you have all the members you need. Time for the festival to begin, kupo!
12302 : After squeezing my moogle sources some more, they told me that people used to eat these during the festival. Here, you take one as well, kupo!
12303 : It looks like you have all the members you need, kupo!
12304 : In fact, the moogle grapevine tells me that this is the perfect Doll Festival combination, kupo!
12305 : As a reward for your blind luc--I mean, resourcefulness, I'm going to give you lots of these treats, kupo!
12306 : Just in case you didn't know, the three girls in your party represent ladies of the court who wait on the empress. Moogles know everything about festivals, kupo!
12307 : And by the way, the five guys in your group represent musicians who entertain the empress and emperor. I wish I could play an instrument, kupo!
12308 : Kupo!? Something's not right... Ah! This is a girl's festival and you don't have a girl in your party, kupo!
12309 : Kupo... I know I said this was a girl's festival, but you need at least one guy to play the emperor, kupo.
12310 : You obtain % and %!
12311 : You obtain %, %, and %!
12312 : You obtain %, %, %, and %!
12313 : You obtain 3 %, 3 %, 3 %, and 3 %!
12314 : Kupo? What happened to your ten-person party? You can't trick presents out of me, kupo!
12315 : Ooh, a shiny new adventurer! Join in the fun, kupo!
12316 : You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day. Try again tomorrow, kupo!
12317 : Hey! Your party has different members all of a sudden! Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!
12318 : Hey! Your party has lost touch with its feminine side! You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!
12319 : Hmm... You seem to have lost your male element. Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!
12320 : At the request of a certain society, I am investigating the effects of the dreaded Emptiness on living beings.
12321 : You appear to be a well-traveled adventurer. Perhaps you have seen one of the Emptiness-ravaged creatures of which I speak?
12322 : We have labeled these monstrosities Empty Notorious Monsters, or ENMs...
12323 : Have you seen one? Indeed I have. I'm not quite sure...
12324 : Aha, so you have firsthand experience. You probably don't need a scholar's explanation, but please indulge me...
12325 : The material presence of ENMs has become temporary and insubstantial, meaning that those who have witnessed a particular ENM's existence are unable to encounter it again until a period of time has passed.
12326 : My research has allowed me to measure the length of time between ENM manifestations. Tell me, which ENM would you like to know about?
12327 : I wish to know about the ENM in... Nowhere in particular. The Spire of Holla. The Spire of Dem. The Spire of Mea. The Spire of Vahzl. Monarch Linn. The Shrouded Maw. Mine Shaft #2716. Bearclaw Pinnacle. Boneyard Gully.
12328 : You won't be able to encounter that particular ENM until  ( Earth time).
12329 : The ENM in that area should be sufficiently manifest for your next encounter.
12330 : You have no need of my expertise at the moment? Very well.
12331 : And now we come to the crux of the matter...
12332 : If there is an ENM that you are currently able to locate, I strongly urge you to take action.
12333 : These...creatures...are no longer natural beings of Vana'diel. They must be destroyed.
12334 : I cannot elaborate on the details, but know that the fate of the world depends on the early elimination of this threat...
12335 : Then perhaps it is best if you forget this conversation entirely.
12336 : I hope I have been of some assistance to you.
12337 : This dark plague grows ever stronger... If it is not stopped soon...
12338 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!
12339 : We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
12340 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders! Behold the wondrous %, kupo!
12341 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.
12342 : But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!
12343 : Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
12344 : The % will absorb a part of the villain's aura every time you attack, kupo.
12345 : Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!
12346 : By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor. They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!
12347 : Here's a new %. Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!
12348 : If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
12349 : Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!
12350 : I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy! Here's your reward, kupo!
12351 : With all the aura you've absorbed with the %, we've managed to create a new weapon. We'd like you to have it, kupo!
12352 : Which item will you use to enter? %. %.
12353 : Festival time, kupo!!! We moogles have come up with a new game for you to enjoy called "Azimuth Circle"!
12354 : Azimuth Circle is played in pairs! First, find a partner and make a party, kupo!
12355 : After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!
12356 : However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!
12357 : At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo.
12358 : Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!
12359 : That's all there is to it, kupo! To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!
12360 : That's all there is to it, kupo! Your partner seems to already be participating in the game. If you want to play together, ask your partner to cancel the current game and talk to a moogle again!
12361 : Will you participate in Azimuth Circle with your partner, kupo?
12362 : Play the game? Ready to go! I'll pass.
12363 : When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!
12364 : If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!
12365 : Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?
12366 : Well, kupo? You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?
12367 : Cancel participation in Azimuth Circle? Yes, freedom! I'll keep playing, thanks.
12368 : Your game has been cancelled. If you want to try again, speak to a moogle, kupo!
12369 : Wow, you found it! Enjoy your reward, kupo!
12370 : This isn't the item your partner found! We're still waiting on the item you got from your friend, kupo!
12371 : You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo! Would you like to cancel the current game instead?
12372 : We can only pass out one item to you each day, kupo!
12373 : The direction of your partner's checkpoint is [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast] as seen from your partner!
12374 : There is a compass here that points to the direction of your partner's checkpoint. The compass is pointing [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast].
12375 : You see something lying on the ground!
12376 : You cannot check any more checkpoints.
12377 : Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!
12378 : We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!
12379 : Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!
12380 : But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!
12381 : If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho.
12382 : Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo! Just take care, and good luck, kupo!
12383 : It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!
12384 : We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!
12385 : We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?
12386 : Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!
12387 : There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.
12388 : You'll help us out, kupo?
12389 : Help the moogles? I'll give it a try. I have other things to do.
12390 : Oh, I just remembered! I think that the cards are all addressed to people who are wearing red...
12391 : Good luck!
12392 : If you change your mind, just let me know, kupo.
12393 : This card is addressed to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, kupo!
12394 : This card is addressed to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, kupo!
12395 : I've been waiting! I've got a present for you, kupo!
12396 : I have a request, too. I've got presents for all the other adventurers, too, but I can't find everyone. I need your help, kupo!
12397 : I need you to give this card to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, and have them bring it back to me, kupo!
12398 : Oh, and the person should be wearing the same red clothing you are!
12399 : I'll wait here and get the present ready! Thanks, kupo!
12400 : Did you hand out the % yet, kupo? If you forgot who to give it to, just bring it to a moogle and you'll get a reminder.
12401 : You forgot who to give the % to? Find a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s and hand it over, kupo!
12402 : You can only hand out one card a day, kupo!
12403 : Are you bringing joy to the children of Vana'diel? Don't keep all that happiness to yourself, now!
12404 : What's the best way to make a child smile? Why, presents, of course! Children nowadays want all kinds of goodies. I'm a bit behind the times, so I'm afraid I can't offer any good advice as to what would be the best present.
12405 : But if you want to avoid suspicion, you'll need a red hat like mine. All smilebringers have them!
12406 : They should be for sale somewhere around here, so snap one up if you want it!
12407 : [You haven't brought any happiness to the children!/You've done some good./You have done fairly well./You have given the children much joy!/You have brought smile upon smile to the children!/You have the children bursting with glee!/The children love you!] [What a disappointment./You just need to give a little extra effort!/Keep it up!/You make a good smilebringer./Excellent work!/Stupendous job!/Even I think you're great!]
12408 : You can make good use of some of that joy you've brought to transport yourself to another nation. The children in other parts of Vana'diel need smiles, too!
12409 : Transport to another nation? Not now. Go to San d'Oria. Go to Bastok. Go to Windurst.
12410 : Happy travels!
12411 : Sorry, but it looks like you don't have enough joy and happiness in your life to do that. You can earn some by giving presents to children, though!
12412 : ...Yes?
12413 : You're looking for %? Sorry, but we're all out.
12414 : Hey, Boytz. When did you say we were getting more of that magic dust stuff?
12415 : I just put in an order with our suppliers, so it'll probably be a while.
12416 : If you're in a hurry, you could go directly to the source. Look up Chamama in the Federation of Windurst.
12417 : Hey, %. It's me. I used these spectacles to change shape again, and now I'm stuck like this.
12418 : I came back here to try and figure out what went wrong...
12419 : I'm going on my break. Mind the front, would you?
12420 : No problem. Don't eat too many of those new spicy Galkan sausages.
12421 : Welcome to Boytz's Knickknacks. We have everything you need.
12422 : Do you have one of those... You know...one of those...whatsits?
12423 : You'll have to be a little more specific, sir. Are you looking for a weapon? A shield? Some other type of goods?
12424 : No, not a weapon or a shield... Ummm... Hmmm... Now what was it called...?
12425 : Some type of food? A medicine? Furnishing of some kind?
12426 : Yes...a medicine. Can't quite place the name of it...
12427 : The most common type would be the standard potion.
12428 : Hmmm? What was that, young man?
12429 : A potion.
12430 : A po...what now?
12431 : A potion.
12432 : A po...come again?
12433 : A potion!
12434 : A po...I'm sorry, just can't quite seem to...
12435 : A P-O-T-I-O-N! Should I write it down for you!?
12436 : Hmmm... I just don't understand you young people today. I'll come back some other time when you're not so testy.
12437 : Gaah! Stay out of my store, you crazy old boot!
12438 : That's it! I crashed into the wall when I was trying to run away!
12439 : That would explain this crack in the lens... Another potential profit-maker ruined!
12440 : Love is in the air! It's time for Valentione's Day celebrations, kupo!
12441 : There is an amazing type of chocolate whose filling is influenced by your feelings! When chocolate halves from a boy and a girl are matched together, the resulting whole produces a wonderful taste if the couple is meant to be, kupo!
12442 : Young men and women in this town have broken their chocolates in two, hoping to meet that special someone!
12443 : We want adventurers to help each of them find their perfect match, kupo!
12444 : Here's what you should do, kupo: Take the two halves of a piece of chocolate from a Valentione Single.
12445 : There are four lonely guys and four forlorn girls who need your matchmaking expertise. Try talking to someone of the same gender as you, kupo!
12446 : When they hand over their chocolate halves, the singles will give you hints about the type of person they're head-over-heels for, kupo.
12447 : You should be able to find an adventurer of the opposite gender who is holding a chocolate half from the perfect paramour for your Valentione Single.
12448 : Trade the right halves of the chocolates with your adventuring colleagues and try to match them with the left half you received from the Valentione Single.
12449 : When matching the halves, the single who gave up the left half may also meet the preferences of the single who gave up the right half.
12450 : If both the singles meet each other's preferences, you'll have a match made in heaven, kupo!
12451 : Don't forget who you got your chocolate from! Try to do too many things at once and you'll end up confused, so we suggest you hand in the chocolate halves to a moogle one pair at a time, kupo.
12452 : We moogles can take your lonely pieces and make them into one whole, complete chocolate!
12453 : Then all you have to do is return the finished chocolate to the person who gave you the original piece. One bite will tell them if they've found their perfect partner!
12454 : After you've returned a whole chocolate to four Valentione Singles, return to a moogle and collect your reward, kupo!
12455 : While you're playing matchmaker, you might meet someone who puts a sparkle in your eye, too. Kupohoho!
12456 : Or maybe you could take advantage of this romantic occasion and make a party with that special someone while you exchange chocolates, kupopopo!
12457 : Want to try again? Match up all the lovebirds you can, kupo!
12458 : Something wrong, kupo?
12459 : Something wrong? Listen to the rules again. Give up. Not really.
12460 : Four people hold the chocolates you seek. Make them into four whole chocolates and give one to each person. When you're finished, return to a moogle, kupo!
12461 : You aren't planning on giving up, are you?
12462 : Quit the game? Yes. Not yet.
12463 : If you want to start over, you'll have to get rid of the chocolates you have now.
12464 : Really give up? Yes! No, not yet!
12465 : Just think of all those poor singles! You'll come back and help them later, won't you, kupo? You should get rid of your chocolates in a subtle manner, so that you don't hurt anyone's feelings! ...We wouldn't want you getting a stomachache either, now would we, kupo?
12466 : You've managed to gather complementary pieces of chocolate! Wait just a moment, now...
12467 : ...
12468 : Kupopopo! What a beautiful piece of chocolate! No need to thank me, now. Hurry and give it to the Valentione Single!
12469 : Great work, kupo! You delivered chocolates to everyone! I've been getting lots of feedback about it! The response has been...
12470 : Excellent! I thought my heart was going to flutter out of my furry little chest--you score # [point/points]! The power of love is amazing, kupo!
12471 : Decent. You score # [point/points]. Everyone seems relatively happy! Not bad, kupo.
12472 : Well, let's just say that some things just weren't meant to be. You score # [point/points]. Sorry, but I won't hand out a reward this time, kupo.
12473 : My bag is filled with goodies for helpful adventurers like yourself! Take your pick!
12474 : Which item would you like? Let me think. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12475 : Are you absolutely sure, kupo?
12476 : You really want %? Yes, that's the one! On second thought...
12477 : You must wait a bit longer to try again, kupo.
12478 : You have to throw away all of your chocolates before playing again, kupo! It might seem a waste, but a rule is a rule!
12479 : Oh, I've been waiting for this moment! You'll help me find my perfect woman, right? Wow, thank you!!!
12480 : I really like [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! They're fantastic! Here's a piece of chocolate. I hope you bring back the best chocolate ever! Good luck!
12481 : You still haven't brought any chocolate? I've been waiting so long for this, so hurry up!
12482 : Hey, what do you want? You could go see a moogle or something!
12483 : <gasp>! Y-you brought me a chocolate! I'm going to savor its delicate flavor...and then I'll let you know what I think! Thank you!
12484 : Hey. I heard you're playing the matchmaker around here.
12485 : Hmph, guess I might as well let you know my type. I like [Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra], and I like 'em [cheerful/kind/shy/modest]. I leave this chocolate, and my future, in your hands. Well, go on. Get on with it.
12486 : What? Still...? Oh well, keep it up. Looking forward to the results.
12487 : What do you want? I don't think I know you.
12488 : Well, you were able to get a finished chocolate after all. I need some time to think, though. After all, this could determine my future, so I will taste it later. Thank you.
12489 : I have been waiting all my life for this! You'll match me up with a girl, right? Wow! Me and a girl, together! Imagine!
12490 : Oh, oh, let's see...I'll tell you exactly what I want! I want a [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! She also must cook things like steamed catfish every night, love watching Ballista, and have an interest in airship mechanics...er, ignore those last few requests. Anyway, here's some chocolate! Go get me a woman!
12491 : Oh wow, thanks for doing this for me! I can't wait for my chocolate!
12492 : What? What do you need? Nothing? Okay, then!
12493 : Wooow, you really got a chocolate for me! I'll let you know how it tastes later! Oh, thank you, thank you! I hope you can get a real, live [girlfriend/boyfriend] someday, too!
12494 : N-no way! I can meet...a woman? One that...likes me!? ...Oh, wow!
12495 : Okay, okay...I'm going to tell you my type. Let's see...I'd like an, um...ack, this is so embarrassing. I'd like a [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! Y-yes, that's my order! (Oops...maybe I went too far just now...) Anyway, h-here's a chocolate!
12496 : Ahhh! By Altana, you scared me! Not finished yet? O-oh, I'm sorry!
12497 : What!? ...Oh, you want something? I-I'm fine!
12498 : Ahhh! You really got a chocolate for me! B-but, I don't see anywhere I could eat it now! I'll have to tell the moogle what I think later. Wow, this is great! See ya!
12499 : Hiya! I've been waiting for you, sugar! Going to find a real sweetheart for me, are you? Yay!
12500 : Listen closely, now! I liiike...[cheerful/cool-headed/honest/shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] boys! Teeheehee! Here's a chocolate! Doesn't it look yummy? Good luck!
12501 : What's wrong, pumpernickel? Not having trouble, are we? I really want a man, so please hurry up!
12502 : Hm? Want something? You should go talk to a moogle!
12503 : Oh, I've been waiting! I wonder what it tastes like! I'll let you know what I think later. Thank you so much!
12504 : Why, hello! This looks like quite an exciting event, doesn't it? I hope I can also meet a nice guy.
12505 : [Cheerful/Cool-headed/Honest/Shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] guys are just my type. Here's a chocolate. You have my support! I wish you the best of luck!
12506 : Hello! You seem to be working very hard. I'm really thankful! But you needn't rush around so fast. Take your time! I can wait if it makes the job easier for you!
12507 : Yes? You have a question? Oh, I'm sorry. I think you've got the wrong person, but don't worry about it!
12508 : Wow, you brought back a finished chocolate! Thank you so much! I wonder what it tastes like. Teeheehee, I can't wait to try it. I hope you meet someone special, too!
12509 : Aaah! Oh...hi! Um, today is...and I...well, that is... <sigh> I can't bring myself to say it!
12510 : Well, here goes nothing. I want [a cheerful/a cool-headed/an honest/a shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] boyfriend! A-and here's a chocolate... Th-thank you! (I can't believe I just said that!)
12511 : Eep! Oh, y-you haven't brought a chocolate back yet? You really scared me, you know! Anyway, good luck!
12512 : Y-yes? What is it? I...um, I don't need anything...
12513 : What? Th-this...could it be? You got me a chocolate! I can't eat it here, though...that would be sooo embarrassing. But I will eat it later, so thank you!
12514 : Hello... I may not look like much, but I do hope to meet a nice guy...
12515 : I really like [cheerful/cool-headed/honest/shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] men. Please take this chocolate. It may not be the best in the world, but I hope you can use it to find someone.
12516 : You're not finished with the chocolate yet, are you? I knew it would be hard to find someone for a girl like me...
12517 : What's the matter? I don't think there's anything I need...
12518 : I see you got a chocolate for me. I can't tell how good it will be until I taste it, but maybe there's hope for me after all. Thanks so much for helping me.
12519 : %'s badge flashes brightly.
12520 : What do you want? Oh, you think because I'm just a kid you can walk over and flash that badge at me for no good reason?
12521 : True, I might look like a child now, but I know I was once a great warrior, and I can prove it. Your little badge doesn't impress me.
12522 : This is no place for you to be wandering around. You outsiders never listen.
12523 : I don't know about any of this Aht Urhgan business, but don't bring your problems to me.
12524 : What's this? You want information on the Empire of Aht Urhgan?
12525 : The alchemists from there are really top-notch--even better than the ones here!
12526 : If you can get your hands on some Near Eastern alchemy products, I bet they'd sell for a nice amount of gil here.
12527 : Beastmen are the same all over Vana'diel. All they ever do is cause trouble.
12528 : A mercenary could take care of them, though...not a bad choice of profession.
12529 : Good of you to drop by the Bat's Lair Inn! Oh my, that's quite a shiny badge you've got there!
12530 : The nation that made that badge must have pretty advanced technology to make it gleam so!
12531 : Come and celebrate the Doll Festival with us, kupo!
12532 : We've got items for everyone! Here you go, kupo!
12533 : Come again and bring your friends! Each of them will also get an item, kupo!
12534 : You can get items only once each day, so come back again tomorrow, kupo!
12535 : You obtain # ), # ), # ), and # )!
12536 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!
12537 : The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
12538 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans! Behold the wondrous %, kupo!
12539 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
12540 : But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!
12541 : Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
12542 : If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
12543 : Kupopo! The Sunbreeze Festival's main event is back and better than ever!
12544 : And this time, it's called Azimuth Circle...II!
12545 : Would you like to know more, kupo?
12546 : Want to know more? Fill me in! I'm okay for now, kupo.
12547 : To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.
12548 : So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!
12549 : Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!
12550 : We've set up several checkpoints outside.
12551 : The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!
12552 : What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!
12553 : And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!
12554 : Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.
12555 : But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!
12556 : And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.
12557 : So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!
12558 : Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!
12559 : That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!
12560 : You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!
12561 : Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!
12562 : Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?
12563 : Is this partner okay with you? Perfect! I want to go with someone else...
12564 : Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!
12565 : Kupo? Where'd your partner go?
12566 : I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!
12567 : I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.
12568 : Kupopo! Congratulations! You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...
12569 : Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!
12570 : We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?
12571 : Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.
12572 : It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.
12573 : Are you ready now, kupo?
12574 : Leave town? Send me out! Not yet...
12575 : Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!
12576 : Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.
12577 : If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!
12578 : I can only give each person one item a day!
12579 : Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!
12580 : Kupo? You already have %...
12581 : Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!
12582 : The moogle hands % a small compass made from scintillant ore.
12583 : If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo!
12584 : What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!
12585 : Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...
12586 : Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...
12587 : Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...
12588 : % returns the compass to the moogle.
12589 : You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.
12590 : What is it? Do you want to start over?
12591 : Start over? Yes, please. No thanks.
12592 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!
12593 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
12594 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
12595 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
12596 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
12597 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
12598 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
12599 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
12600 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
12601 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
12602 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
12603 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
12604 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
12605 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
12606 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
12607 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
12608 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
12609 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
12610 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
12611 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
12612 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
12613 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
12614 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
12615 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
12616 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!
12617 : The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...
12618 : The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.
12619 : I'm Zopago, advanced chocobo trainer and member of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society.
12620 : You like chocobos, don't you? I can tell just by the look in your eyes. If you want, you can join our society.
12621 : Trade an egg to me if you want to start raising a chocobo.
12622 : You seem to be raising a chocobo at another nation's stables. Just ask Gonija if you have any questions.
12623 : Hello there! Your chocobo should be fully grown in no time!
12624 : This week's schedule: Minimum care (no charge). Emphasis on exercise (1200 gil). Physical training (1300 gil). Rest (1500 gil). Ask about current condition. Ask for a care report. Never mind.
12625 : All you want for your chocobo this week is the minimum level of care? There is no charge for this service, but it will not help your chocobo grow...
12626 : An emphasis on exercise, is it? Your chocobo will run and build leg strength with this program.
12627 : Physical training, is it? Your chocobo will spend time exploring outside and digging with this program. It should help your animal build a strong beak and claws.
12628 : Giving your chocobo a rest will allow it to recover from accumulated fatigue and restore a great deal of energy.
12629 : Choose this program? Yes. No.
12630 : Understood. Your chocobo is in good hands with us this week.
12631 : Changed your mind? When you decide on a program, please let me know. If there is no word from you, we will continue to give your chocobo the minimum level of care.
12632 : You seem to be raising your chocobo well.
12633 : It does not seem to have any serious illness or sudden changes in temperament. Everything looks to be in perfect order.
12634 : All that you have been providing for your chocobo is the minimum level of care. As a result...
12635 : Your chocobo's legs are a bit stronger than average...
12636 : But its overall physical strength is a bit lower than average.
12637 : Come back any time. Your chocobo is counting on you!
12639 : Kweh!
12640 : (It seems to be in good spirits.)
12641 : Kweh.
12642 : (It looks well.)

12714 : This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.
12715 : You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.

12729 : Digging for treasure will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal and may decrease its stamina.
12730 : Your chocobo can even appear in plays. This will require your chocobo to perform simple acts and will improve its receptivity.
12731 : You will receive a gil payment for this service, but appearing in a play will have a negative effect on the animal's strength and will place some strain on your chocobo.

12762 : [Watch over the chocobo/Tell a story/Scold the chocobo/Compete against others/Go on a walk (short)/Go on a walk (regular)/Go on a walk (long)]? Yes. No.
12763 : You should wait until your chocobo has more energy before doing that...
12764 : If you watch over your chocobo, it will gradually return your affection.
12765 : Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on the animal, though.
12766 : When your chocobo acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love. It is important to scold your chocobo the moment it acts up!
12767 : You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing. Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as it's done peacefully.
12768 : Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. If you don't wander off too far, your chocobo should not get very tired, either.
12769 : Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. You should try wandering out just a bit sometimes. It might tire your chocobo a bit, but could have some positive effects as well.
12770 : Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. Wandering far from town on a walk will expose your chocobo to all sorts of new experiences!

12779 : If you trade the card to the chocobo matchmaking authority in Jeuno, you can match up your animal with other chocobos. You can buy a chococard for # gil.
12780 : Purchase a chococard? (# gil each) Yes. Not now.
12781 : To enter your chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you must first receive %.
12782 : Then, simply trade that document to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
12783 : Would you like a free form? Right away! Maybe later.
12784 : You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your %.
12785 : Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.
12786 : You can register a retired chocobo by trading % to me.
12787 : However, I will require a small fee.
12788 : Register a chocobo? (# gil) Yes. Not now.
12789 : I shall make the necessary preparations, then.
12790 : I will now register % to come when you call.
12791 : I require # gil for preparations.
12792 : I shall ready your chocobo, then.
12793 : You lost your %? Of all the irresponsible...
12794 : Anyway, I can give you a new %, but you're going to have to pay # gil for it.
12795 : Purchase %? (# gil) Yes. Not now.
12796 : Hm... This seems to be in great condition! We shouldn't need to do any work on it at the moment.
12797 : Hm... This %'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak...
12798 : For a small fee, I can give you a new % in exchange for it if you wish.
12799 : Pay for a new whistle? (# gil) Yes, please. Not yet.
12800 : Here you go. Take good care of it.
12801 : All right... You can have this back, then.
12802 : I cannot accept a fee from you this time. The % is all I require.
12803 : Here, take this.
12804 : Are you sure that you want to stop caring for this chocobo?
12805 : Stop caring for your chocobo? Yes. No!
12806 : You will never be able to see your chocobo again. Is that okay with you?
12807 : Understood. Care of your chocobo will transfer to the stables. Do you have any last words?
12808 : What would you like to say? Nothing. I'm sorry. It's just an animal! We weren't compatible. Take good care of it.
12809 : Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...
12810 : Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...
12811 : ... I'm disappointed in you.
12812 : I don't think it's a matter of compatibility. A chocobo is not a toy!
12813 : We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.
12814 : Of course not! Whew, you had me frightened for a second there! Don't say such things!
12815 : You really want to retire your chocobo?
12816 : Retire your chocobo? Yes. Not yet!
12817 : Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?
12818 : Understood. We hope you enjoyed raising your chocobo.
12819 : Of course not! Such a decision cannot be made in haste!
12820 : Your chocobo learns Gallop!
12821 : Your chocobo learns Canter!
12822 : Your chocobo learns Burrow!
12823 : Your chocobo learns Bore!
12824 : Your chocobo learns Auto-Regen!
12825 : Your chocobo learns Treasure Finder!
12826 : I'm afraid we still aren't finished using the %, so I will have to return your item to you.
12827 : You give the % to the chocobo.
12828 : The chocobo looks like it's already full, but it's forcing itself to eat...
12829 : Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. You cannot feed it now.
12830 : Your chocobo has run away. You cannot feed it now.
12831 : You cannot feed a chocobo that has not hatched yet.
12832 : It seems like it will have some sort of effect on the chocobo...
12833 : Let me know if you have any questions about chocobo raising.
12834 : What would you like to ask about? The Vana'diel Chocobo Society. Time required. Chocobo attributes. Care schedule. Caring for your chocobo. Feed. Abilities and personality. Retirement. Matchmaking. Calling chocobos in the field. Items. Lost chicks. Nothing.
12835 : Just let me know if you ever get curious!
12836 : The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.
12837 : They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.
12838 : Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.
12839 : Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.
12840 : They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.
12841 : The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.
12842 : But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!
12843 : Ask about which attribute? Strength. Endurance. Discernment. Receptivity. Energy. Affection. Satisfaction. Nothing.
12844 : Strength is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.
12845 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
12846 : Endurance is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.
12847 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
12848 : Discernment is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.
12849 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
12850 : Receptivity is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.
12851 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
12852 : Energy is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.
12853 : You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!
12854 : Affection is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!
12855 : You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.
12856 : If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it %, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.
12857 : Satisfaction is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.
12858 : However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.
12859 : What would you like to ask about? What is a care schedule? Basic care. Resting. Taking a walk. Listening to music. Exercising alone. Exercising in a group. Interacting with children. Interacting with chocobos. Carrying packages. Exhibiting to the public. Delivering messages. Digging for treasure. Acting in a play. Nothing.
12860 : A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.
12861 : How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.
12862 : You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).
12863 : When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.
12864 : With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.
12865 : The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.
12866 : You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.
12867 : The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.
12868 : However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.
12869 : We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.
12870 : Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.
12871 : Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.
12872 : If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
12873 : Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.
12874 : If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
12875 : Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.
12876 : However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.
12877 : If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
12878 : Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.
12879 : But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.
12880 : If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
12881 : You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!
12882 : The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.
12883 : You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.
12884 : The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.
12885 : You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!
12886 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
12887 : You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.
12888 : The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.
12889 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
12890 : You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.
12891 : You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
12892 : What would you like to ask about? A general explanation. Watching over your chocobo. Telling a story. Scolding. Competing. Taking a walk. Nothing.
12893 : In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.
12894 : Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.
12895 : On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.
12896 : However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.
12897 : You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.
12898 : Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.
12899 : You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.
12900 : I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)
12901 : Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.
12902 : This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.
12903 : Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.
12904 : You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.
12905 : I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.
12906 : Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!
12907 : What would you like to know about? Why feeding is important. Vegetables. Wildgrasses. Carrots. Worms. Medicines. Pastes. Nothing.
12908 : Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.
12909 : However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.
12910 : The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.
12911 : At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!
12912 : Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.
12913 : There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!
12914 : Just trade the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.
12915 : This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which % are most popular.
12916 : Chocobos also seem to enjoy % and %.
12917 : These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.
12918 : Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.
12919 : %, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to %, the effects are different.
12920 : In addition, % is effective for illness, and % for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.
12921 : Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.
12922 : %, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and % are good for its mental attributes. % are in a category of their own.
12923 : Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.
12924 : Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!
12925 : For example, % will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and % will restore its energy.
12926 : But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...
12927 : The most curious of all the worms is the %. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...
12928 : Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.
12929 : % will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.
12930 : % are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.
12931 : A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.
12932 : Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.
12933 : You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.
12934 : Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.
12935 : Which would you like to ask about? Abilities. Temperament. Weather preferences. Nothing.
12936 : Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.
12937 : For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.
12938 : Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.
12939 : But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.
12940 : The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.
12941 : Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.
12942 : Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.
12943 : Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.
12944 : You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.
12945 : After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.
12946 : When your chocobo retires, you will receive %. Be sure not to lose it.
12947 : You can use the % to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.
12948 : The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!
12949 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.
12950 : You will need % and % if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.
12951 : You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them %.
12952 : I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.
12953 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using %.
12954 : You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.
12955 : That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.
12956 : When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade % to a VCS member.
12957 : Also, the %'s power will grow weak after you've used it several times.
12958 : If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.
12959 : What would you like to ask about? %. Chococards. %. Nothing.
12960 : % proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.
12961 : With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.
12962 : If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!
12963 : You can use % to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.
12964 : The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.
12965 : Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get %, so good luck with that...
12966 : Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.
12967 : If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.
12968 : Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.
12969 : If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade % to a VCS member.

13140 : Lately,  has been making an awful fuss at night.
13141 : Chicks have a tendency to cry a lot, but I think this may be worse than normal...
13142 : %, could you hold on to this % for a while?
13143 : Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.
13144 : That should be enough. Let me see the % now.
13145 : should be able to sleep well with this.
13146 : Thanks to the %,  has been sleeping soundly at night.
13147 : I have not seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep.
13148 : I will dispose of the % for you.
13149 : Your chocobo has finally grown large enough to ride? Magnificent news!
13150 : As you say, % is required to call the animal in the field, and as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society, it is my duty to distribute them. However...
13151 : has finally grown large enough to ride!

13158 : has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!
13159 : I must say,  has never looked better!
13160 : You will need % in order to call it in the field. It is my duty as president of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society to distribute them, but...
13161 : I gave this to  when it was but a chick.
13162 : I am afraid  seems to trust me more than you...
13163 : You gave me an egg quite recently. I cannot care for two at once.
13164 : I am afraid I cannot take your egg because you are already in the process of raising a chocobo.
13165 : I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables.
13166 : You would like to tend to this egg?
13167 : We will provide it with the best of care, then... Let us make a fine chocobo out of this egg.
13168 : A chick has hatched from the egg!
13169 : Adorable, is it not? You may name it at a later time.
13170 : Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause a number of inconveniences when it comes time to fulfill certain procedures for the animal after it matures.
13171 : Just look at that color! It will not be long until  is fully grown!
13172 : And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.
13173 : You have done a magnificent job raising this chocobo. Now is the best time to improve its attributes.
13174 : And I must say,  is beginning to develop quite a distinguished air.
13175 : 's growth seems to have stabilized. The animal has developed quite a distinguished air.
13176 : And I must say,  seems quite satisfied. You have raised one fine animal.
13177 : But, %... You still haven't named it.
13178 : Well then, I shall give the poor animal a name. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...
13180 : Your chocobo seems to like its new name.
13181 : I am terribly sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with your chocobo.  will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.
13182 : Do not fret; this will not be your last meeting.
13183 : will come to you whenever you call.
13184 : is injured, but I am sure it would heal quickly if we had %.
13185 : 's injury has completely healed.
13186 : seems to be a bit under the weather. % should fix it right up, though.
13187 : 's illness has completely healed.
13188 : seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?
13189 : seems to have a stronger stomach these days.
13190 : seems lonely. You should venture out together sometime.
13191 : no longer seems lonely.
13192 : ...Oho, you are not afraid that it has stopped caring about you, are you?
13193 : I am not sure what to say to that!
13194 : seems quite perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.
13195 : seems to have had its fill and has calmed down.
13196 : is sleeping soundly right now, so you should not disturb it.
13197 : has been waking up every morning as of late.
13198 : is very ill. We need % in order to help it.
13199 : 's fever has gone down.
13200 : seems bored and restless. You should have it compete against other chocobos sometime.
13201 : seems to have more zest for life nowadays.

13392 : I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.

13396 : I've got an idea. Could you hold on to this % for a while?

13400 : Thanks to the %,  has been sleeping like a baby.

13418 : A chick has hatched from the egg!
13419 : Isn't it cute? You can name it later.

13422 : And boy does it have a lot of energy! Maybe a little too much, I'd say!

13626 : %, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.

14082 : You've got a certain way about you... Could it be...?
14083 : Show him Leleroon's letter? Yes. No way.
14084 : A letter from Leleroon? That's great news!
14085 : <Sniff sniff>...
14086 : That's the scent of the Qiqirn, all right.
14087 : Sorry... I'm just amazed by your powers of observation... You saw right through my disguise even in this giant town!
14088 : I'm Watzahl, the most skilled craftsman that ever sailed on the Black Cradle.
14089 : There are so many materials for my craft in the Middle Lands that I just can't find elsewhere... All the excitement's kept me here far longer than it should.
14090 : But I do miss Aradjiah... The Seagull Phratrie's been pretty active lately, haven't they?
14091 : Heh heh, of course I know what's going on in the Near East. You would be wise not to underestimate the power of the corsair information network.
14092 : Well, I might as well take this opportunity and head back to see how everyone's doing in Aradjiah!
14093 : (I'd like to see Leleroon again, too.)
14094 : ...Ah, I almost forgot. You wanted to talk to me about something, didn't you?
14095 : Judging by the look of ya, you probably want %, don't you?
14096 : Heheh, I knew it. Never underestimate the corsairs' powers of observation.
14097 : I'll need %, %, %, and %...
14098 : With them, the legendary corsair armor can be yours.
14099 : Bring everything to me, and I'll show you some real craftsmanship.
14100 : %, %, %, and %
14101 : Don't forget!
14102 : Now hurry up and get the goods.
14103 : I'll need some % for my share...
14104 : You've heard of them before, right? Bring me #, and we have a deal.
14105 : Get them here no matter what it takes, got it?
14106 : Don't forget--# )!
14107 : Great. Now just leave everything to me.
14108 : Come back later, and I'll have some shiny new armor just waiting for you to try on.
14109 : Impatient, aren't we? Go play dice with some kids or something, and I should finish in no time.
14110 : Your order is ready. Here ya go... They're yours now.
14111 : I made these especially for you, so use them wisely, all right? I guarantee their practicality.
14112 : Well, I better head for Aradjiah now...
14113 : See you on Arrapago Reef when you're ready!
14114 : The door is firmly shut...
14115 : Ahhh, the pain! The sheer agony! Here I stand on the verge of the single greatest breakthrough in the long and storied history of the alchemical arts, and--the Twilight God take me--I lack for the key ingredient necessary to consummate my life's work! If only--
14116 : Wait...could it be!? That battle-ready posture! That confident mien! No, no, you needn't tell me! You're an adventurer, come to help a troubled genius in his time of dire need! Am I right or am I right?
14117 : Am I right? Uh...you're right. Couldn't be more wrong.
14118 : Ah, for shame! To think the world must wait until another day to bask in the brilliance of my unprecedented discovery!
14119 : I knew it! My wits are as sharp as ever, if I say so myself--which I just did!
14120 : As you see, the supremely complex experiment I'm conducting demands nothing short of my undivided attention, so I hope you'll forgive me if I speak to you from here.
14121 : At any rate, here is the task I would entrust to you. Certainly an adventurer of your caliber has heard of--perhaps even set foot in--the mountainous crags that lie beyond Gustaberg: the area they call Grauberg.
14122 : It is there, sleeping in the bed of a river that runs beneath a mountain vast, that one can find a very special variety of gold dust, imbued with just a speck, a smidgen, a sliver of magical energy! ...Or so they say.
14123 : I would ask you to venture to Grauberg and retrieve this vital ingredient for me, that the world--nay, the universe--might reap the harvest sown by the seeds of my immense genius! What say you, adventurer?
14124 : What say you? Leave it to me! I say do your own work.
14125 : What!? I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to share in a groundbreaking moment that will go down in the annals of science, and you would simply walk away!? I know not what vile madness takes you, [man/woman], but may the Goddess have mercy on your soul!
14126 : Ah, excellent! Excellent! I knew it from the start--clearly, you're a [man/woman] with a sense for history in the making!
14127 : Very well, then. Take this % and retrieve the magical gold dust I seek.
14128 : According to my thoroughly infallible calculations, twenty grains should do the trick.
14129 : Bring them back here in this %, and prepare to bear witness to the dawning of a new era in alchemy! You'll want to ready yourself a pair of shaded spectacles, 'cause the future is going to be bright, bright, bright!
14130 : My adventuring friend! Have you managed to secure the enchanted gold dust I seek? Why, we mustn't keep the world waiting any longer--a truly epoch-making moment hangs in the balance!
14131 : How to get to Grauberg, you ask? Come to think of it, the path leading there has been obstructed for as long as I can remember. But hey, you're the adventurer--I'm sure you'll figure something out! Now, chop chop!
14132 : Wait, could it be!? That self-satisfied expression! That sprightly gait! No, no, don't tell me, now! You've returned triumphant with the ingredient I seek! Am I right or am I right?
14133 : Spectacular! So pure, and simply oozing with magical energy! To think that such immaculate specimens remain in this day and age...
14134 : To tell the truth, I had my doubts that a scruffy-looking straggler like you could pull it off, but you've far exceeded my (admittedly low) expectations!
14135 : But why am I standing around chit-chatting with the help when there's history to be made!? Behold as I unveil the first step of the process that will redefine our glorious discipline!
14136 : Bwahahaha! Yes...yes! All is proceeding precisely according to plan!
14137 : Now all I do is take the refined gold dust--like so--and a shiny new weapon specially prepared by our guild for this momentous occasion, and...
14138 : History, here I come! Genius has a new name, and that name is Titus!
14139 : What...? No! It couldn't be!? Failure!? I've failed!? Oh, unmerciful Goddess, how you torture me so!
14140 : Oh, alas and alack! Years of research for naught! Am I destined to live out the rest of my life as a nobody!? A grimy lump of fool's gold to be trodden beneath the feet of my more accomplished peers!? Woe, oh woe is me...!
14141 : You're still here? Pray leave me. I am a failure, a nothing, a nobody! I cannot bear to have anyone look upon my wretched self!
14142 : Hmm? What's that you say? Why, what have we here!? Though the synthesis failed, the materials are miraculously intact...!?
14143 : What luck! What fortune! The Goddess smiles upon her poor Titus after all! Stand back, friend! I've been given another chance at history, and I mean to make the most of it!
14144 : Eureka! I've done it! I've truly done it!
14145 : I really am a genius! Why, I never doubted myself for a second! See how it glows with unearthly power! Truly an achievement that will be celebrated by alchemists--nay, by enlightened beings the world over--for ages to come!
14146 : What does it do, you say? Why, it imbues a potent dose of alchemical skill to anyone who wears it! Amazing, is it not?
14147 : Think of it as my way of sharing just a smidge--a trifle, mind you--of my limitless genius to the less intellectually endowed! Ha-ha!
14148 : And for your contributions to this glorious day, you may consider it yours! A round of applause for the good [man/woman]!
14149 : It's just a prototype, mind you, and there are still a few kinks to be worked out, but hey, let's not sweat the details!
14150 : That glowing smile! That awestruck expression! Don't tell me--you're simply overjoyed to own a piece of history. Am I right or am I right?
14151 : Anyhow, it's back to work for me. This is one genius who isn't going to rest on his laurels! And don't be leaving town, okay? After all, it shall only be a matter of time before my next groundbreaking discovery!
14152 : What? You say you've got my chocobo!?
14153 : That's great news! The only time I ever really feel relaxed is when I'm with that little guy.
14154 : You're raising a chocobo yourself, aren't you? Let me teach you a story I always tell mine...
14155 : You've found my chocobo!?
14156 : You just made my day, [mister/lady]! There hasn't been a day gone by that I haven't thought about the little squirt. As thanks for helping me out, let me teach you a story I know...
14157 : The only things an adventurer needs are courage, a good suit of armor...and companionship.
14158 : You've got my chocobo!?
14159 : Oh, those big, puppy-dog eyes! That sweet little chirp! I can't wait to see the little featherball again!
14160 : Ahem... I must thank you. Let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...
14161 : You've found my chocobo, have you?
14162 : I thought he'd run away because I spend too long working.
14163 : Thanks for finding him. In return, let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...
14164 : Goodness, you've found my chocobo?
14165 : To think I'll get to see the little darling again...she was a real hit with the customers. I was afraid it wouldn't last...
14166 : You're raising a chocobo too, right? Here, let me teach you a nice story...
14167 : You've got my chocobo!? Are you serious?
14168 : It all happened in West Ronfaure... Just when I was thinking how beautiful the day was, thick fog seemed to appear out of nowhere and hid the little chocobo from my sight!
14169 : Thank you so much for finding him! As thanks, let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...
14170 : You've...you've got my chocobo?
14171 : ... What a relief...
14172 : I thank you for your kindness, [sir/ma'am]. As thanks, let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...
14173 : Eh? Ya say ya've got my chocobo? Is that so?
14174 : I'm not sure I heard that right. Could ya speak up, or am I imagining things again?
14175 : Ohhh, bless your soul. A young [lad/lass] like you might just be able to use this... Let me tell you a little story, [sonny/missy]...
14176 : Stop joking around. I've got work to do. My chocobo's at home waiting for me to finish.
14177 : You say you've got my chocobo?
14178 : [Sir/Ma'am], the only things an adventurer needs are courage, a good suit of armor, and lips that don't lie.
14179 : You say you've got my chocobo?
14180 : My chocobo would never leave me! Nobody's closer than me and my chocobo!
14181 : Well, it's true that I can't care for my chocobo as much as I'd like, considering my employment...but I'd never let it wander around lost. You must have me confused for someone else.
14182 : Goodness, you say you've got my chocobo?
14183 : Sorry, but it can't be mine. My chocobo was entertaining customers just a moment ago.
14184 : You say you've got my chocobo?
14185 : That can't be true. I would never take my eyes off my chocobo while we're on a walk.
14186 : There are two kinds of chocobos in this world: those that belong to me, and those that don't. The chocobo that you speak of is one of the latter.
14187 : Eh? Ya say ya've got my chocobo?
14188 : Greetings. I am a journeyman trainer from the VCS, and I have been sent to this town to promote knowledge exchange between chocobo owners.
14189 : We believe that the best way to promote interaction between owners is through interaction between chocobos.
14190 : And after countless VCS conferences, we recently agreed on the establishment of a new program--
14191 : Kamp Kweh!
14192 : Breeders need only possess a chocobo to join. Please speak with me again if you are interested.
14193 : I can answer your questions regarding Kamp Kweh?
14194 : What would you like to know? What exactly is Kamp Kweh? How do I sign up? Are there any restrictions? Nothing at all.
14195 : Kamp Kweh is a place where fellow breeders can bring their chocobos to interact with each other.
14196 : At the camp, owners can check the status of their companions' animals...
14197 : ...as well as confirm breeding compatibility.
14198 : However, please note that any results from these tests are merely estimates, and may not fully reflect the actual condition of an animal.
14199 : Our wish is that through the various camp activities we offer, your chocobo will have the opportunity to improve its skills.
14200 : Only adventurers who are currently raising a chocobo can participate.
14201 : Owners can enroll their animals once they have hatched.
14202 : To begin, adventurers should first form a party of those who wish to participate, and then come talk to me or any of the other VCS journeyman trainers stationed throughout Vana'diel.
14203 : Please note that only up to six chocobos can attend the camp at one time, so do not come as an alliance.
14204 : We refuse admission to the following:
14205 : 1. Any owners who have not checked up on their chocobos recently. Those who feel that they may have been neglecting their animal may want to visit the stables before attempting to participate.
14206 : 2. Chocobos who are sleeping or have run away.
14207 : 3. Chocobos who have yet to be named.
14208 : 4. Party members who are too far away from the stables.
14209 : We would not think of leading a chocobo away from its pen when the owner was not present.
14210 : Welcome back. Have you come to enroll in Kamp Kweh?
14211 : Enroll? Yes. No.
14212 : I see. If you wish to participate in the future, feel free to contact me or one of my companions.
14213 : I am sorry, [sir/ma'am], your chocobo is currently unable to participate. Please confirm your chocobo's condition and speak with me again when everything is in order.
14214 : None of the other members of your party possess chocobos able to participate in camp activities. Please confirm their conditions and speak with me again when everything is in order.
14215 : None of your party members are close enough to the stables to participate in camp activities. Please speak with me again when everyone has assembled.
14216 : Now that we have arrived, we can begin.
14217 : What do you wish to do? Call your chocobo. Let it play with others. Check the chocobos' vitals. Check mating compatibility. Nothing.
14218 : Cheep!
14219 : Kwee!
14220 : Kweh!
14221 : seems relaxed.
14222 : seems excited.
14223 : seems pleased.
14224 : seems distressed.
14225 : seems happy.
14226 : looks like it wants to play with you as well.
14227 : Which chocobo? . . . . . Quit.
14228 : Something unexpected has arisen... I'm sorry, but I cannot allow your chocobos to play together.
14229 : The two seem to be getting along just fine.
14230 : The elder of the two seems to be treating the other as a younger [brother/sister].
14231 : Your chocobo's strength has slightly improved.
14232 : Your chocobo has become slightly more patient.
14233 : Your chocobo has become slightly more intelligent.
14234 : Your chocobo has become slightly more receptive.

14346 : You may only hold up to 1000 chocobucks at any given time. Excess chocobucks over this amount will be discarded. Are you sure you wish to proceed with the transaction?
14347 : You cannot carry more than 1000 chocobucks.
14348 : You have # [chocobuck/chocobucks] remaining.
14349 : Excuse me [sir/ma'am], but you dropped this.
14350 : How many? (Max.: #)
14351 : You need # chocobuck[/s] to purchase the %.
14352 : Because you have made a total of # exchange[/s], I am authorized to give you # more as [a freebie/freebies].
14353 : Is [yellow/black/blue/red/green] okay? (# chocobuck[/s]) Yes. (50 chocobucks) No.
14354 : Is [yellow/black/blue/red/green] okay? (Current: [yellow/black/blue/red/green]) Yes. No.
14355 : 0:# 1:# 2:# 3:#  4:# 5:# 6:# 7:#
14356 : Hey you! Yeah, I'm talking to you. What? You were talking to me? Whatever... The point is, we are now talking, and boy, do I have some good news.
14357 : The suits down at VCS headquarters have been burning the midnight oil to bring you excitement and merriment like none you've ever experienced in this life or any others.
14358 : That's right, I'm talking about the all new, completely original Chocobo Hot and Cold Game!
14359 : Listen, you've noticed the gaggles of chocobos frolicking about recently, no?
14360 : Well, thanks to this poultry population explosion, the local stables have found themselves with their hands full when it comes to caring for the birds.
14361 : I've even heard rumors that some establishments don't even have the manpower to take the steeds on their daily walks, leaving the chocobos with less meat on their bones than a corse in a windstorm.
14362 : Why, just yesterday I saw a chocobo so weak, she couldn't dig a hole in a San d'Orian omelet. I swear on my grandmother's grave, Goddess bless her chocobo-loving soul.
14363 : What I'm trying to say is, if we don't do something quick, Vana'diel will be filled with nothing but deflated bags of feathers!
14364 : And that's why the bigwigs down at the VCS sent me here--to help you!
14365 : The Chocobo Hot and Cold Game has been designed by chocobo experts from around the globe to return the pep to your noble steed's step. All you need is to love your chocobo enough to want to help it. Don't you love your chocobo?
14366 : Let your bird take part in the excitement, and before you know it, you'll have one lean, mean, pecking machine.
14367 : And, not only will the bond between you and your bird become better...
14368 : ...but if you're lucky, you may find yourself belly-deep in bushels of bountiful booty!
14369 : Can you think of a better way to spend a Windsday afternoon!? I know I can't!
14370 : VCS officials have been spending the past few weeks burying chests filled with wondrous goodies in secret locations all over Vana'diel.
14371 : All you have to do is find them, and they're yours. No strings attached!
14372 : What do you say?
14373 : You love your bird, and I can tell by that drool trailing from the side of your mouth that you love treasure. So why not multiply the love? Love squared!
14374 : Square your love? Let's play. Not today.
14375 : I know, you need time to think it over. I completely understand. I guess someone else will have to find those Genbu shields that we hid...
14376 : Good answer!
14377 : Wait a minute... You have a chocobo, but you don't have the maps for the areas around the big three?
14378 : I'm talking about the %, the %, and the %. You've heard of them, right?
14379 : Well, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you'll need all three of those maps before you can play. Come back when you have them and we'll begin.
14380 : Alright. Now, before we begin, I'm required to give you a briefing of the official VCS rule book.
14381 : What do you need to know? About chocographs. About %. About how to find the loot. About chocobo abilities. About when the game is over.
14382 : Anyone who wants to participate in the Chocobo Hot and Cold Game will require a special chocograph authorizing [him/her] to dig in a certain area.
14383 : There are all kinds of chocographs for all kinds of treasure located in areas all over Vana'diel.
14384 : Oh, and once you obtain one, it's yours for life, or until you set your gobbiebag on fire.
14385 : Wait, I know what you're thinking--where do I get my hands on one of these chocographs?
14386 : Well, don't you worry, because for a limited time, the VCS is giving away not one, but two! That's right, TWO chocographs absolutely free to any adventurer who signs up!
14387 : % is the tasty weed that you'll need to start the game.
14388 : Take a clump to the area specified on a chocograph and set it out in front of you. Before you know it, your very own chocobo will come running (or walking, depending on how many carrots you've been giving it) to your side.
14389 : Once it arrives, your map will open and you'll have the opportunity to confirm the general location of the buried treasure in that area.
14390 : Please note that once your chocobo has consumed the %, you'll need to obtain another from a VCS representative before playing again.
14391 : Ah yes... The loot. Well, first ride your chocobo out to the location indicated on your map.
14392 : When you think you're close, take a test dig and see what happens.
14393 : As you probably already know, your chocobo has a nose for finding buried goods. A third sense, you could call it.
14394 : Depending on the distance you are from the treasure, the reaction of your bird will change.
14395 : When you think you've found the X that marks the proverbial spot...
14396 : ...kick your chocobo's beak into 5th gear and start digging!
14397 : Some treasure has been buried quite deep, so it may take a few tries before you actually reach anything.
14398 : But with a cup of persistence and a 1/4 tablespoon of luck, you'll uncover a chest filled with surprises that even Pandora would appreciate.
14399 : Then, all you have to do is open it and pocket your prize. It's as easy as Rolanberry pie!
14400 : To maximize your hot and ice your cold, you'll want to know how chocobo abilities can help you get your eyes off, and your hands on, the prize.
14401 : The ones that will help you most are Treasure Finder, Burrow, and Bore.
14402 : Burrow and Bore will allow you to go deeper with each dig, helping you reach the chest before your bird grows too tired.
14403 : Treasure Finder does just that--helps you find the treasure easier by honing your chocobo's sense of smell.
14404 : Now, this part is the most important, so I need you to turn off your linkshell and give me your undivided attention.
14405 : All this digging can put a lot of strain on your chocobo.
14406 : The more you order your bird to dig, the more tired it will become. Overwork it, and it will simply give up and refuse to dig anymore.
14407 : If that's the case, you'll have to hop off your chocobo and let it recover. In other words it's game over, man. Game over!
14408 : Locating the chest in as few digs as possible will be the key to everybody going home happy.
14409 : Trust me.
14410 : And that's it!
14411 : Oh, I bet you'll want some licenses now, huh?
14412 : Okay. Here's a % and a %.
14413 : And here's your %.
14414 : Like I told you before, too much digging is hard on your chocobo, so the VCS prohibits me from giving adventurers % anytime they want some.
14415 : Let your bird rest a while, and visit me again. I'll hook you up.
14416 : Alright. I can tell by the way you're clenching your fists and grinding your teeth that you've heard enough from me.
14417 : Now get out of here, and good luck!
14418 : Wow, this Chocobo Hot and Cold Game has really taken off. You'd think people had played it somewhere before!
14419 : So, what do you need? A rule refresher course. Another dose of Hot and Cold. Nothing.
14420 : Excellent! Here's a new % for you.
14421 : Now what are you waiting for? Get hunting!
14422 : How goes the hunt? Have you found anything interesting?
14423 : If you came for another %, then you're out of luck.
14424 : You'll have to let your chocobo rest a little more before I hand one over.
14425 : Do you need to review the rules? Yes. No.
14426 : Are you ready to find some treasure!?
14427 : Well, you'll need one of th--
14428 : Wait... You already have %.
14429 : We're not allowed to give adventurers more than one, so you'll have to use the one you have before I can give you another.
14430 : The Chocobo Hot and Cold Game is taking Vana'diel by storm. Step right up and...
14431 : Wait a minute... You don't have a chocobo you can call, do you?
14432 : Boy, are you missing out on all the fun!
14433 : DEBUG: Press a button to continue.
14434 : According to my records, you and your chocobo have been quite successful in locating prairie treasure.
14435 : According to my records, you and your chocobo have been quite successful in locating treasure out in the bush.
14436 : Perhaps it is time we offered you a different challenge.
14437 : This % should keep your interests piqued for the next few months.
14438 : With it, you will be allowed to participate in Hot and Cold festivities in the Valkurm Dunes.
14439 : With it, you will be allowed to participate in Hot and Cold festivities on the Buburimu Peninsula.
14440 : The buried treasure there will be considerably more different to find, but you should have no problems. Good luck, and good digging!
14441 : According to my records, it seems that you and your bird have become quite skilled at locating treasure on the Buburimu Peninsula.
14442 : According to my records, it seems that you and your bird have become quite skilled at locating treasure in the Valkurm Dunes.
14443 : You bear the mark of a true digger, %!
14444 : Which is why I'm proud to present you with this new chocograph for the rainforests of Yuhtunga and Yhoator.
14445 : I must warn you, all the different types of exotic foliage in the jungles can play tricks on your chocobo's sense of smell. You'll have to comb wider patches of the landscape than before if you wish to uncover the bounty.
14446 : Which is why I'm proud to present you with this new chocograph for the Eastern and Western Altepa Deserts.
14447 : I must warn you, the unrelenting heat of the noonday sun, combined with the deserts' loose sands, will take their toll on your chocobo. You must be extra careful in choosing where to dig, as your bird will tire quickly.
14448 : Visit the Chocobo Circuit? Off to the races! Not right now.
14449 : The door is locked...
14450 : Welcome, kupo!
14451 : Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.
14452 : I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.
14453 : Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess % or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.
14454 : How about you, [sir/ma'am]?
14455 : If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in [Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.
14456 : What do you say? Tell me more. Sign me up! Not today.
14457 : Congratulations, %! You are now an official member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
14458 : I see. Please come back if you ever change your mind!
14459 : What would you like to know? Why race chocobos, anyway? How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kind of races are there? What are racing teams? Quit. Return.
14460 : Why not!? Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.
14461 : We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A win-win situation, as we like to call it in the business.
14462 : However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...
14463 : The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.
14464 : And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.
14465 : Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!
14466 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
14467 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
14468 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
14469 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
14470 : Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.
14471 : Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.
14472 : In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.
14473 : Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.
14474 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
14475 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
14476 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
14477 : There are two main types of races.
14478 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
14479 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
14480 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
14481 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
14482 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.
14483 : You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)
14484 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
14485 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
14486 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
14487 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
14488 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
14489 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
14490 : Ah, it says here that you are a member of the [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
14491 : Have you come today to change your affiliation?
14492 : Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
14493 : Join this team? Yes. No.
14494 : Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!
14495 : Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.
14496 : Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.
14497 : What do we have here...
14498 : %:
14499 : Alright, %, I will store this in our safe.
14500 : Alright, %, I will store these in our safe.
14501 : I am sorry, but you have already brought me one of those.
14502 : I am sorry, but you have already brought me these items.

14506 : You cannot access this menu until you have registered a chocobo to race.

14516 : ----------------------------------------
14517 : Free Run Chocobos: 8 Objective: None
14518 : While free runs usually have no specific objectives, the higher your chocobo places, the better the prize you will receive. We suggest you use these races to improve your skills before embarking on the more difficult official races.
14519 : Here is the information on the next race:
14520 : Novice Race I Chocobos: 4 Objective: Place 3rd or higher

14522 : Novice Race II Chocobos: 6 Objective: Place 3rd or higher
14523 : This time, your chocobo will be pitted against five opponents. Use your knowledge of your bird's strengths to provide the jockey with the most appropriate orders.
14524 : Novice Race III Chocobos: 8 Objective: Place 3rd or higher
14525 : This race is quite similar to a free run in that there will be seven other chocobos racing against you. If you have one available, try equipping an item to improve your bird's performance.

14569 : All of us here are eager to see what accomplishments you will achieve next!
14570 : Oh, and do be careful with your %. If you happen to accidentally dispose of it, you will never be able to receive one again.

14581 : Greetings! I've been sent by the VCS to observe the final touches being put on our new racing facilities.
14582 : In addition, my colleagues and I will spend the next few weeks training for our positions as receptionists, vendors, and announcers.
14583 : Our grand opening is but a few days away. I hope to see you and all of your companions back for the big event!
14584 : Ah, %. We have been holding on to the prize from your last race until you had room enough in your gobbiebag to carry it back to your Mog House.
14585 : Might you be %? Excellent. VCS headquarters was informed that you would be stopping by our branch, and sent this package containing the prize from your last race.
14586 : %, thank you for waiting.
14587 : Much to the VCS and the CRA's delight, the recent efforts of chocobo breeders across Vana'diel has helped to generate an unprecedented amount of interest in our endeavor. More people than ever have begun to express an interest in raising their own chocobo.
14588 : As a means of expressing our gratitude, we have therefore decided to confer upon the victors of CRA Classics rewards befitting a champion. We congratulate you on your impressive achievement, %. You are a true inspiration for breeders everywhere!

14662 : Here you can sign up your race chocobo to take part in our races.
14663 : Please note that once you sign up for a race, you will be unable to compete again for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).
14664 : All right. First of all, we will have to choose a saddle for your mount.
14665 : Which saddle would you like to use? Lauan saddle. Ash saddle. Elm saddle. Brass saddle. Silver saddle. Mythril saddle. Grass saddle. Cotton saddle. Linen saddle. Rabbit hide saddle. Sheep leather saddle. Buffalo leather saddle. Quit.
14666 : A standard model, the lauan saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride.
14667 : A standard model, the ash saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride. It also increases your mount's endurance.
14668 : A standard model, the elm saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride. It also increases your mount's endurance.
14669 : A bit on the hefty side, the brass saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
14670 : A bit on the hefty side, the silver saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
14671 : A bit on the hefty side, the mythril saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
14672 : This lightweight grass saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
14673 : This lightweight cotton saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
14674 : This lightweight linen saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
14675 : Crafted from the finest rabbit hide, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
14676 : Crafted from the finest sheep leather, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
14677 : Crafted from the finest buffalo leather, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
14678 : Now that that's settled, if you'd kindly select the lane in which you'd like to race. The lanes are numbered in ascending order from innermost to outermost. The following lanes are now available:
14679 : In which lane would you like to race? Lane 1. Lane 2. Lane 3. Lane 4. Lane 5. Lane 6. Lane 7. Lane 8. Quit.
14680 : I know that look! Lane # it is!
14681 : Race fees will include a charge of # gil and # [chocobuck/chocobucks].
14682 : Do you wish to proceed? Yes! I'm ready to tear up the track! I'm getting cold feet...
14683 : Very well. You have now been registered to race.
14684 : My apologies, but it seems that over four weeks have elapsed since your last race. As much as it pains me to do so, I will be forced to deduct # Solo Victory [Point/Points] from your account.
14685 : I'm sorry, but I am unable to process your registration at this time.
14686 : I apologize, but the slot you have applied for has already been taken.
14687 : I understand your eagerness, but sadly, not enough time has passed for you to register for a new race. Please try again later.
14688 : I'm sorry, but only racers affiliated with one of the three recognized racing teams are eligible for signup.
14689 : It seems you have not yet fulfilled the necessary requirements for race eligibility. I'm sorry, but I cannot sign up your chocobo.
14690 : We look forward to seeing you again.
14691 : The race you have signed up for will begin shortly. Please stand by until then.

14700 : Team Windurst places emphasis on their achievements, as exemplified by their leader, advanced chocobo trainer Pulonono.
14701 : Join the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team? Yes, at once. No, not now.
14702 : If you would just wait one moment while I fill out the necessary paperwork...
14703 : Congratulations, %! You have just become the newest member of the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!
14704 : You really want to nullify your affiliation with the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team and join another?
14705 : Changing team affiliation will result in you losing all of the Solo Victory Points you currently have accumulated. Can you live with that?

14707 : Your current statistics are:
14708 : Solo Victory Points: # Number of races: # First-place finishes: # That's it.

14749 : Helping your team into first will give you certain advantages over your rivals! That should give you something to strive for!
14750 : What would you like to know about? The promenade. Chocobet centers. The grandstand. Portals. Guides. Nothing for now.
14751 : Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.
14752 : It can be found just south of here.
14753 : The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.
14754 : Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring %, as well as collecting your winnings.
14755 : There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.
14756 : All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.
14757 : The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.
14758 : To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.
14759 : The standard admission fee is # gil. Patrons who possess % may enter free of charge.
14760 : % will be provided anytime you purchase % or sign up for a race.
14761 : Your % will become invalid as soon as you leave the grandstand. Reentry will require you to pay an additional admission fee.
14762 : This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.
14763 : As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.
14764 : For the same reasons, we ask that visitors refrain from setting up bazaars while here. Violators of this rule will be severely punished. Your cooperation is appreciated.
14765 : Guides can be found throughout the premises waiting to assist you.
14766 : They can help by transporting you to the location of your choice.
14767 : This service is provided free of charge, so please don't hesitate to make use of it.
14768 : What would you like to know about? Racing teams. Race rules. Race types. Victory points. Race Progression. That's about it.
14769 : A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.
14770 : Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.
14771 : In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.
14772 : For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.
14773 : The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.
14774 : What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.
14775 : Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.
14776 : Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.
14777 : The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.
14778 : The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.
14779 : The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.
14780 : In such an event, the less endowed of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.
14781 : Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.
14782 : Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the race grade.
14783 : For example, a C4 Chocobo Race would indicate a typical grade 4 race.
14784 : We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.
14785 : No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.
14786 : Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.
14787 : As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.
14788 : Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.
14789 : Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.
14790 : Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.
14791 : The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.
14792 : As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.
14793 : Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.
14794 : We have a total of four races that run in succession.
14795 : Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.
14796 : Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.
14797 : Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!
14798 : What would you like to hear more about? Race preparations. Signup procedure. Collecting winnings. Signing up for another race. I'm fine, thanks.
14799 : There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.
14800 : First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.
14801 : Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a race chocobo, for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.
14802 : Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...
14803 : All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.
14804 : A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.
14805 : Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.
14806 : There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.
14807 : There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.
14808 : Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given %, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.
14809 : In the event that you should lose or misplace your %, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.
14810 : The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!
14811 : You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.
14812 : To collect, simply hand in the % you received during race signup at any signup center.
14813 : The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.
14814 : You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.
14815 : After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).
14816 : This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.
14817 : We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.
14818 : What would you like to ask? What is chocobetting? How do I bet? What are odds? When do I bet? How do I collect winnings? Nothing.
14819 : Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.
14820 : To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.
14821 : Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.
14822 : For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.
14823 : And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.
14824 : Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.
14825 : The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!
14826 : To place a chocobet, you must obtain % from the chocobet center.
14827 : For any single %, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.
14828 : We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.
14829 : Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.
14830 : Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.
14831 : It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.
14832 : What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.
14833 : Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.
14834 : The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.
14835 : Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.
14836 : Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.
14837 : Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.
14838 : Once the race is finished, you can exchange your % at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.
14839 : Without % you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.
14840 : % is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.
14841 : Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.

14896 : Greetings, and welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service area is here to accommodate our more experienced and accomplished racers.
14897 : I am truly sorry [sir/ma'am], but we are unable to service your request here. This service area only caters to [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] CRA Classic winners.
14898 : Registration for such an event can be carried out at the service areas for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
14899 : The organizing attendants in each location are as follows: [Southern San d'Oria: Alangriche/Bastok Mines: Jazgeh/Windurst Waters: Turumi-Byrumi] [Northern San d'Oria: Monteverle/Bastok Markets: Galienne/Windurst Port: Lhimo Keanyohn] [Port San d'Oria: Ramiene/Port Bastok: Salvador/Windurst Woods: Rungaga].
14900 : For beginning and intermediate races, you'll want to speak with [Alangriche/Jazgeh/Rungaga].
14901 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
14902 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for advanced and veteran racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
14903 : Which would you like to hear about? CRA rationale behind veteran races. How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kinds of races are there? What are racing teams? What about race opponents? Quit. Return.
14904 : With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.
14905 : As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!
14906 : The Monster Races!
14907 : Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing!
14908 : Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele. What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?
14909 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
14910 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
14911 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
14912 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
14913 : Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!
14914 : The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal. It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.
14915 : Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern. If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.
14916 : Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area. Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.
14917 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
14918 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
14919 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
14920 : There are two main types of races.
14921 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
14922 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
14923 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
14924 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
14925 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.
14926 : You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Thank you for your understanding.
14927 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
14928 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
14929 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
14930 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
14931 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
14932 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
14933 : Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.
14934 : We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence. The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.
14935 : Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits. And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.
14936 : As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind. It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack. Consider yourself warned.
14937 : In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well. Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part. It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!
14938 : Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed. These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.
14939 : Dueler's Race Participants: 2 Objective: Place 1st
14940 : And now, Markovich's undeniably unorthodox, and arguably downright unethical, monster race is about to begin!
14941 : Survival Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
14942 : Following such a fine showing in the Dueler's Race, the next contest is about to start! Who will be the last beast standing?
14943 : Deadly Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
14944 : Warning! The next race contains monsters of unprecedented nastiness. Enter at your own risk! The name says it all!
14945 : Mystery Race Participants: 4 chocobos & 4 ??? Objective: Place 1st
14946 : What's this? We've been asked to pass along yet another challenge, this time from an anonymous source! I'm not altogether clear on what is about to transpire...
14947 : Lethal Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
14948 : The games are over, ladies and gentlemen. Markovich is laying it all on the table. Here come his most ferocious beasts to date!
14949 : Dream Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
14950 : This is the moment you've all been waiting for. The CRA has brought its racing elite out from the stables! The treacherous offroad track is fraught with perils! And an absolutely awe-inspiring trophy is ready for the winner! Bragging rights for life are on the line!

14999 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.
15000 : Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...
15001 : ...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.
15002 : Good day, fol--
15004 : Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.
15005 : Alrighty then, our next race features # of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.
15006 : First we have , who will be ridden by [the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing allstar, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].
15008 : She says, When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.
15009 : She says, And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' allstar!
15010 : She says, This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.
15011 : She says, There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.
15012 : She says, This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.
15013 : She says, Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.
15014 : She says, This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.
15015 : She says, This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'
15016 : Next we have [Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by [the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].
15017 : Sakura says, Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!
15018 : Sakura says, This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.
15019 : Sakura says, Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.
15020 : Our next chocobo is [Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by [Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].
15021 : Sakura says, Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.
15022 : Sakura says, She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.
15024 : Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...
15025 : The next contestant is [Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by [chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].
15026 : She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.
15027 : She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.
15028 : She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.
15029 : And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.
15030 : And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?
15031 : The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.
15032 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
15033 : And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
15034 : ...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!
15035 : Good day, fol--
15037 : Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.
15038 : And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!
15039 : ##:  ##:  ##:  ##:
15040 : And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
15041 : Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
15042 : I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.
15043 : Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!
15044 : Yeah... Good luck, %...
15045 : Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.
15046 : And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, [Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].
15047 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'
15048 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.
15049 : Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.
15050 : They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.
15051 : Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell [him/her], Wahboud!
15052 : Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!
15053 : As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.
15054 : %. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.
15055 : Good luck, %. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!
15056 : Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!
15057 : And next we have [Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by [VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].
15059 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.
15060 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.
15061 : Sakura says, Big things often come in small packages.
15062 : Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--
15063 : a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!
15064 : This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.
15065 : Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!
15066 : It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted piece de resistance?
15067 : We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.
15068 : Well, there you have it.
15069 : Now let's take a look at today's participants...
15070 : Ladies and gentlemen! President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...
15071 : ...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!
15072 : Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.
15073 : Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?
15074 : Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?
15075 : Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--
15076 : The Rakapopo Cup!
15077 : Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Kupipi!
15078 : So, I've learned that you have entered your very own personal chocobo in the cup. What do you think her chances are of taking home the grand prize?
15079 : Are you making fun of me, sir!? Well, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my gutty-wutty when my Starlight sails across the finish line years before the nearest competitaru!
15080 : Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.
15081 : My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!
15082 : [Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing allstar/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Never heard of [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!
15083 : We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one Kamp Kweh. We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.
15084 : Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...
15085 : Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take more than an embiggened brainy-wainy to beat Starlight!
15086 : What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.
15087 : Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...
15088 : Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fan! I won't let Starlight lose to some imposter!
15089 : Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called reincarnate's redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!
15090 : Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?
15091 : Hah! Well, I have been riding chocobos for twenty-one years!
15092 : And next is [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by [San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!
15093 : Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.
15094 : Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...
15095 : Both Starlight and the professor hate to take orders... Maybe that's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!
15096 : The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.
15097 : When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.
15098 : When the professor's not stumbling over his speech impediment-ethy, he's researching the intricacies of chocobo behavioral patterns.
15099 : And they're off!
15100 : Markovich, what did you think of the start?
15101 : Well, I fel--
15103 : Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
15104 : Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
15105 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
15106 : And as they pass the halfway mark...
15107 : ##  holds on to the lead!
15108 : # different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!
15109 : While from behind the pack, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
15110 : While from behind, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
15111 : All # chocobos battle for the lead!
15112 : Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
15113 : And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
15115 : Sakura says, The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.
15116 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
15117 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
15118 : Incredible! 's speed is approaching dangerous limits!
15119 : It looks like  is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!
15120 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
15121 : 's speed has begun to drop off!
15122 : It looks like  has begun to tire!
15123 : The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
15124 : The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
15125 : The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
15126 : The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
15127 : The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for !?
15128 : Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for !?
15129 : And yet  seems completely unaffected by the attack!
15130 : And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
15131 : And now they're approaching the final corner!
15132 : ##  still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
15133 : It's crowded up front with # chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
15134 : ##  is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
15135 : It's crowded up front with all # chocobos still fighting for the lead!
15136 : The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
15137 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching ##  today!
15138 : And  takes the crown!
15139 : What's this? ##  is making its move on the lead!
15140 : And it's  by a beak!!!
15141 : Let's take a look at the results...
15142 : #:  (##)
15143 : There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!
15144 : Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.
15145 : Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.
15146 : Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.
15147 : What an amazing race! The other chocobos were no match for [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?
15148 : What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?
15149 : [Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!
15150 : The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.
15151 : Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!
15152 : Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...
15153 : Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exactly as I expected!
15154 : The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no way Starlight could lose! Her horoscope said so!
15155 : And there you have it. This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!
15156 : And now, let's see the results from the last race.
15157 : #:  (##)
15158 : And that's all she wrote, folks!
15159 : The winnings for a #-# bet come to # gil per quill!
15160 : Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
15161 : She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
15162 : She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
15163 : Until next time, race fans...
15164 : Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.
15165 : Taking the crown for today's race was none other than !
15166 : To the winning steed's owner we present the %, %, and the exalted title of Rocochookie, I mean, Chocorookie!
15167 : And to the ambitious and sporting %, we present this undeniably useful %!
15168 : Good show, %. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.
15169 : Excellent race, %! You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.
15170 : Okay, maybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I still think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!
15171 : Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.
15172 : But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.

15186 : With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...
15187 : Oh...? Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?
15188 : I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.
15189 : Is that so...? Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...
15190 : Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone. You of all people should know that the show must go on!
15191 : Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own baby will be taking the field!
15192 : Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!
15193 : But of course! I had forgotten all about it! Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you! Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!
15194 : But that's not where it ends! There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?
15195 : A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself. Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?
15196 : It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.
15197 : Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state! But...
15198 : But...?
15199 : I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.
15200 : I see... Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?
15201 : You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo. Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?
15202 : But enough talking, I say. It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!
15203 : Oh, yes, right... Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay! It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!
15204 : In the chocobo corner, we have , undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.
15205 : Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo? I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.
15206 : 's formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, a wolf in sheep's clothing!
15207 : I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!
15208 : I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?
15209 : Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that monsters like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.
15210 : Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!
15211 : With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!
15212 : Whoopee! Bring them on, I say!
15213 : Erm...yes... Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.
15214 : Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.
15215 : Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki! Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.
15216 : Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo. I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.
15217 : And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!
15218 : My, oh my...! I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--
15219 : A-ahem! I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.
15220 : All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies! Well done, my pretty! Well done!
15221 : It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders... <Sniffle>
15222 : Next in the lineup is Sakura. ...!? What on Vana'diel!?
15223 : Hrmmm... Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
15224 : Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...
15225 : What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man! There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!
15226 : Um, yes... Please forgive me...
15227 : And won't you look at the lineup! This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks? I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?
15228 : And with me today is our regular guest commentator...
15229 : Huh? Why isn't Markovich here?
15230 : Ohohohohohoho! You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.
15231 : <Gulp> You...you're that mage from Windurst...
15232 : ...Professor Shantotto!
15233 : If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich, as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.
15234 : Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence, four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.
15235 : So if you care to hear out my little proposal, these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.
15236 : With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice... Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?
15237 : With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused? Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.
15238 : First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.
15239 : Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold. I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.
15240 : Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.
15241 : Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word failure. Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.
15242 : Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.
15243 : Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable. If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.
15244 : Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!
15245 : For Ace of Trophies, championship contender is an unfitting description. Even consecutive champion would not be too high an expectation.
15246 : Um...Professor Shantotto... Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?
15247 : Ohohohohoho! Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so. But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!
15248 : Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage. Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.
15249 : Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview. So let the race begin, without further ado!
15250 : Ohohohohohoho! Of this inevitable result, I was always assured-- that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!
15251 : The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor. But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.
15252 : H-hey! What do you think you're trying to pull here!?
15253 : My, my, what a pleasant surprise! I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.
15254 : How dare you ohoho your way into my hard-earned commentary seat! This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!
15255 : Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification. I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.
15256 : And you, Goccilo! What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!
15257 : Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing! Until next time...!
15258 : %, I knew you'd make it all the way here.
15259 : What's with the baffled expression? It's me, Sakura.
15260 : You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird. I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.
15261 : I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.
15262 : I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...
15263 : And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.
15264 : I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.
15265 : Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.
15266 : I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.
15267 : I hope that'll be your chocobo, %!
15268 : And next, we have Sakura. But something seems to be different... Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.
15269 : She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!
15270 : The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.
15271 : I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround! A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.
15272 : And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.
15273 : It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.
15274 : And that completes the lineup, folks. With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!
15275 : You find %.
15276 : Welcome to the Dream Race, %.
15277 : I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.
15278 : I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.
15279 : I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.
15280 : But no more... If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.
15281 : This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.
15282 : I won't hold back in today's race, %.
15283 : Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.
15284 : Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.
15285 : I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?
15286 : Next, we have Sakura...
15287 : Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!? This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!
15288 : Well I'll be... In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!
15289 : ...
15290 : Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks. For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?
15291 : %, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded %, %, and the exalted title of Chocochampion!
15292 : Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far! Congratulations!
15293 : Great race, %. It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.
15294 : But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come.. With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...
15295 : Princess... Princess Sakura!
15296 : Princess...? What are you talking about? Who are you?
15297 : Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion. I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.
15298 : Searching for...me?
15299 : Yes, Your Highness. You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.
15300 : Are you serious!? Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?
15301 : That is correct. Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.
15302 : D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?
15303 : ...! I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...
15304 : Wh...what happened?
15305 : You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world. You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...
15306 : She...she gave up her life to save me?
15307 : Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again. But, I never once gave up hope...
15308 : My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.
15309 : So that's what happened...
15310 : Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos!
15311 : ...
15312 : I'm sorry, but I can't go.
15313 : Your Highness! But...why!?
15314 : Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like %'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.
15315 : What's more...
15316 : I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...
15317 : I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.
15318 : What...?
15319 : The only place I belong is here, beside you.
15320 : And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer? I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?
15321 : I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!
15322 : Heehee! Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!
15323 : %, I'm looking forward to our rematch! Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?
15324 : You're still here, eh, %?
15325 : Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?
15326 : What? How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?
15327 : Hohoho... It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.
15328 : I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...
15329 : Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos? No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.
15330 : Sakura is the queen, you say?
15331 : <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises. But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.
15332 : You know what they say: Home is where the heart is. To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.
15333 : And you, our new Chocochampion! Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.
15334 : Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today. These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.
15335 : And they're off!
15336 : Hrmmm! [Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
15337 : Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
15338 : All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance. But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
15339 : Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
15340 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
15341 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
15342 : The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
15343 : The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
15344 : And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
15345 : It's crowded up front with # contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
15346 : It's crowded up front with all # contestants still fighting for the lead!
15347 : The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
15348 : What's this!?  has used %!
15349 : still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
15350 : is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
15351 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching  today!
15352 : What's this?  is making its move on the lead!
15353 : #:
15354 : What's this!? 's using [Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!
15355 : Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those [monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!
15356 : just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed! And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
15357 : I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about 's step.  And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!
15358 : And here's some unexpected drama, folks! The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
15359 : Look at that! 's stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!
15360 : Uh-oh, what's going on here!? The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
15361 : Oooh! In a bold move,  has just used a [Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!
15362 : What's this!? All of the chocobos other than  and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
15363 : Thanks to that brazen little act,  can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks! That just might seal the deal for !
15364 : Never in all my days, race fans! In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
15365 : How could my creation make such a rookie mistake? In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
15366 : Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
15367 : The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
15368 : The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
15369 : The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
15370 : Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!? What in the world do you think you're doing!?
15371 : Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame. This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
15372 : What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today? I've heard it being said that today's [creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal. This could get heavy, folks!
15373 : All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them. Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
15374 : It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
15375 : There's still plenty of race to go, race fans! More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
15376 : And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
15377 : The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now. This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
15378 : This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent. Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
15379 : And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty! Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
15380 : And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them! But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
15381 : I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call! Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
15382 : It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now! The time for a final spurt is now or never!
15383 : And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
15384 : It's here! It's here! The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!
15385 : If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!
15386 : Where would you like to go? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
15387 : See you again, kupo!
15388 : Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!
15389 : Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
15390 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
15391 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
15392 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
15393 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
15394 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
15395 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
15396 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
15397 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
15398 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
15399 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
15400 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
15401 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
15402 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
15403 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
15404 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
15405 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
15406 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
15407 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
15408 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
15409 : You can only carry one %.
15410 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
15411 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
15412 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
15413 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
15414 : Adventurer! Adventurer!
15415 : Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand? Sure! Doing what? Not today.
15416 : A thousand thanks, kupo! Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!
15417 : Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend! All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the cyclopean crystals located about the strongholds, kupo!
15418 : Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?
15419 : You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.
15420 : Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.
15421 : It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces' victory over the beastmen armies?
15422 : And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...
15423 : However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.
15424 : And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!
15425 : By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!
15426 : One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.
15427 : We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.
15428 : Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...
15429 : ...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.
15430 : The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's Most Valuable Nation and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.
15431 : So, what do you say, kupo? I'm in. Maybe later.
15432 : Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!
15433 : Kupopo...
15434 : Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...
15435 : My records show that you have brought your nation a total of # [shard/shards], but I know you're not done yet, are you?
15436 : Amazing! You've already collected # [shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!
15437 : Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!
15438 : Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s fight to prove you are better than those [San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!
15439 : Congratulations on your victory, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!
15440 : Where would like to go, kupo? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
15441 : Happy travels, kupo!
15442 : Moogles from across Vana'diel have heard of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s recent success in collecting crystal shards, and have come bearing gifts! For the next few days, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!
15443 : Oooh! It's %! Your shard-collecting skills have left us Moogles in awe. It's my honor to present you with this special present, kupo!
15444 : ***GM Commands*** ***Use with CAUTION!***
15445 : Set this area's A flag to: Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
15446 : Switch on this area's B flag? No (OFF). Yes (ON).
15447 : Flag settings complete. A Flag: [Nowhere/San/Bas/Win] B Flag: [OFF/ON]
15448 : The Starlight Celebration is here again, kupo!
15449 : And once again, we have a pile of presents for all the adventurers!
15450 : But we've sailed into a slight snag, kupo... There are so many adventurers that we've become...a little...confused...
15451 : Hey! Maybe you could help us find the right adventurer for each present, kupo!
15452 : I'm sure that if we could just meet them in person, we'd remember which gift was meant for whom. All you have to do is make a party with another adventurer, and then visit a moogle, kupo!
15453 : We're counting on you, kupo!
15454 : The recipient for this present was supposed to be [level 37 or lower/level 38 or higher].
15455 : And I'm pretty sure we were looking for [a male Hume/a female Hume/a male Elvaan/a female Elvaan/a male Tarutaru/a female Tarutaru/a Mithra/a Galka].
15456 : Someone who was trained as [a warrior/a monk/a white mage/a black mage/a red mage/a thief/a paladin/a dark knight/a beastmaster/a bard/a ranger/a samurai/a ninja/a dragoon/a summoner/a blue mage/a corsair/a puppetmaster/a dancer/a scholar]...
15457 : If you're having trouble finding the person we're looking for, it's okay to give up for now, kupo.
15458 : Give up for now? That would be best. Not just yet!
15459 : Yeah, that's a tough one, kupo. But I have plenty of other presents here if you'd still like to help!
15460 : Hmmm...I don't think this is the person we're looking for, kupo.
15461 : Hmmm...this isn't the person we're looking for, kupo. But, you know what? I think something's coming back to me...
15462 : Oh, I stumbled across the present that was meant for the adventurer you brought with you, kupo!
15463 : Presents can be claimed using a card just like this! Have your adventurer friend show the card to a moogle and receive a wonderful gift, kupo!
15464 : Yes! This is the person I was looking for, kupo!
15465 : Hand this card to your friend. It can be given to a moogle in exchange for a present, kupo!
15466 : Your help was invaluable! Here, this is for you, kupo!
15467 : There are still so many presents to hand out, kupo! Don't be shy about lending another helping hand!
15468 : I'm so glad we found you! Here's your present, kupo!
15469 : What are you trying to pull, kupo!? Give this card to the person it's addressed to, and have them come to a moogle to receive a present!
15470 : One card at a time! I'm confused enough as it is, kupo!
15471 : I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...
15472 : After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...
15473 : A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the-- Kupopo!?
15474 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
15475 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
15476 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
15477 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
15478 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
15479 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
15480 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
15481 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
15482 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
15483 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
15484 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
15485 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
15486 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
15487 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
15488 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
15489 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
15490 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
15491 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
15492 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
15493 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
15494 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
15495 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
15496 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
15497 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.
15498 : Kupopo! You've absorbed [a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!
15499 : Thanks, kupo. We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!
15500 : You can purify absorbed malice by planting your % here.
15501 : A mysterious power absorbs the malice!
15502 : Please select absorption value. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
15521 : Where would you like to teleport to? . . . . . The Ronfaure Region. The Zulkheim Region. The Norvallen Region. The Gustaberg Region. The Derfland Region. The Sarutabaruta Region. The Kolshushu Region. The Aragoneu Region. The Fauregandi Region. The Valdeaunia Region. Qufim Island. The Li'Telor Region. The Kuzotz Region. The Vollbow Region. The Elshimo Lowlands Region. The Elshimo Uplands Region. Tu'Lia. . The Tavnazian Archipelago. . . . . . . Teleport? Nowhere at the moment.
15522 : That region is under your home country's control.
15523 : That region is no longer under your home country's control.
15524 : That region is under allied control.
15525 : That region is under beastman control.
15526 : That region is neutral.
15527 : Welcome to the Regional Teleportation Service!
15528 : Greetings, adventurer. My name is . I have been sent by the Specialty Goods Trade Union.
15529 : At the previous Conference of Nations, it was decided that the restriction on regional teleporting would be lifted, and that cities could now offer teleportation services to various outposts.
15530 : We are now authorized to teleport you to any outpost you have previously visited on a supplies quest.
15531 : The nominal fee we require varies with the current control of the region.
15532 : Also, depending on your level, there may be some areas I am not authorized to teleport you to.
15533 : That region is [no longer under your home country's control./currently under your home country's control.] You will require # gil or # conquest [point/points] to teleport.
15534 : As a special, limited-time service to commemorate the recovery of the full mog tablet set, I can teleport you to your destination absolutely free of charge!
15535 : Teleport? Yes. Teleport with gil. Teleport with conquest points. Later.
15536 : Have a wonderful journey!
15537 : Unfortunately, at this time there is nowhere I can teleport you. Please come again.
15538 : You have not yet reached level 10. I am sorry, but for safety reasons, I am not authorized to teleport anyone under the current level cap.
15539 : You do not have enough gil. Please come back again.
15540 : You do not have enough gil.
15541 : You do not have enough conquest points. Please come back again.
15542 : You do not have enough conquest points.
15543 : We look forward to seeing you again!
15544 : However, at this time I am only authorized to teleport citizens of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst].
15545 : Debug: Warp to region #!

15552 : This service will last for the duration of the Starlight Celebration.
15553 : Thank you very much for taking part in our holiday special!
15554 : If I remember correctly, you just made your payment a few moments ago.
15555 : I apologize, [sir/ma'am]. You have not completed any supplies quests, thus there are no regions to which I am authorized to teleport you.
15556 : The recommended level for the requested area is #. Are you sure you would like to teleport there?
15557 : Your ten % are returned to you.
15558 : Your inventory is full and you cannot carry the %. Come back when you have created more room in your bag.
15559 : Kupo ho ho! The Starlight Celebration is once again upon us!
15560 : We moogles have spent many a sleepless night preparing for this year's festivities, kupo. Be sure not to miss any of the exceptionally exciting events that are being held in and about town during this most joyous of seasons.
15561 : Oh, and there's one thing you simply must know, kupo. Should you come by any gift tokens, bring them to me and I'll furnish you with gorgeous gifts in exchange!
15562 : Now, run along and immerse yourself in the revelry, kupo!
15563 : Ah, you've brought %! Here, this is for you!
15564 : Wow! That's quite a few gift tokens you have there, kupo!
15565 : If you're interested, I can exchange all the tokens you have for a grand gift of galactic proportion, kupo! Well, perhaps that's exaggerating things a tad.
15566 : Of course, it's perfectly permissible to use them one at time. The decision is entirely yours, kupo!
15567 : How many tokens will you exchange? The whole kaboodle! I'm a miser. Just the one, please.
15568 : That's the spirit, kupo! Here's a super-duper special gift for the [man/woman] who dared!
15569 : Sure thing, kupo. Here, this is your % in exchange.
15570 : Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight! As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for everyone, kupo.
15571 : For this year's Starlight Celebration, we moogles have set ourselves a challenge: breaking the all-Vana'diel present-distribution record! But we couldn't possibly dream of succeeding at such an ambitious undertaking just by ourselves, kupo.
15572 : We could really do with some adventurer-offered assistance. Would you be interested in lending a hand in this noble endeavor, in the spirit of giving, kupo?
15573 : Help the moogles? Sign me up! I'm a little busy, sorry.
15574 : We understand... But we'll be waiting right here if it turns out you can spare some time after all, kupo!
15575 : You've made this little moogle very happy, kupo! Now then, let's not waste any time. We'd like you to deliver these presents here.
15576 : The recipients are Tall Mountain, Tami, Virnage, and Christina. Four people in total, kupo.
15577 : Report back to us after you've completed your task, kupo.
15578 : Also, we don't mind you working in a group if you feel lonesome doing the deliveries on your own. Just form a party and have everyone come talk to us.
15579 : And I have to warn you, presents can't be taken to other areas, kupo. Be careful, okay?
15580 : Happy delivering, kupo!
15581 : We want you to deliver the presents to Tall Mountain, Tami, Virnage, and Christina. Four people in total, kupo.
15582 : You've yet to deliver presents to [Tall Mountain,/Tami,/Virnage,/Christina,] [Tall Mountain,/Tami,/Virnage,/Christina,] and [Tall Mountain,/Tami,/Virnage,/Christina,] kupo.
15583 : You've yet to deliver presents to [Tall Mountain,/Tami,/Virnage,/Christina,] and [Tall Mountain,/Tami,/Virnage,/Christina,] kupo.
15584 : You've yet to deliver a present to [Tall Mountain,/Tami,/Virnage,/Christina,] kupo.
15585 : Wow, you've delivered every single present! Thank you so much, kupo!
15586 : Here's a little something for your kindness.
15587 : You want to help us again? That's very kind of you, but we need more time to put together a new set of presents, kupo. Would you mind coming back tomorrow?
15588 : What? A Starlight Celebration present? You came all the way to this decrepit part of town just to give this to me? You've a good heart, friend. Thank you.
15589 : A Starlight Celebration present for me? Well, aren't you a thoughtful young [lad/lass]! That reminds me, I should get something for that useless husband of mine, too...
15590 : Praise be to the Goddess... Thank you, friend. I gratefully accept the blessing of your Starlight Celebration present. May your kindness be rewarded tenfold.
15591 : Wh-what!? You want to give me a present!? It...it's not that I don't appreciate it or anything... It's just that... Aaah, who am I to argue? Thank you, fellow smilebringer!
15592 : Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight! As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for all adventurers, kupo.
15593 : We'd appreciate your help in distributing the presents. What say you?
15594 : Help the moogles? But of course! I help no one but myself.
15595 : You're truly a role model for all adventurers, kupo! Now then, we'd like you to take this card and give it to a [male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer.
15596 : If you happen to forget who the card's recipient is, just show it to me, kupo.
15597 : Let' see... This addressee of this card is a [male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer, kupo.
15598 : Are you trying to pull a fast one, kupo!? This card isn't yours to give, nor is it addressed to you, so please take it back to where you found it.
15599 : Ah, you've brought us a card! Here's a present in exchange for it, kupo.
15600 : We'd also appreciate your help in distributing cards, kupo. All you're required to do is deliver this card to the addressee. We're counting on you!
15601 : Things have settled down for the time being. But we may have need for your help later on, so don't wander too far away, kupo.
15602 : Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
15603 : I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain %.
15604 : Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
15605 : May I be of service? Not now. Learn recipes. Check fewell. Replenish fewell. Purchase materials. Receive training. Trade cinder. Get information.
15606 : Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
15607 : ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.
15608 : I've got it! How about %? Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...

15627 : There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
15628 : But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your % for a moment...
15629 : Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: # # # # # # # #.
15630 : Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
15631 : Replenish fewell? Yes. No.
15632 : Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
15633 : ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
15634 : Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for # gil.  How does that sound?
15635 : Pay # gil? Deal! No thanks.
15636 : Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
15637 : I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
15638 : Excellent! Now we just pop open your % here, and...
15639 : There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
15640 : Your % has been filled to capacity!
15641 : You hand the synergy engineer # gil.
15642 : How do you expect me to do that when your % is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
15643 : Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
15644 : Purchase something? Not today. # %: # gil. # ): # gil. # ): # gil.
15645 : For # %, that comes to # gil.
15646 : Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
15647 : ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
15648 : And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
15649 : Train in which technique? Cancel. Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: #) Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: #) Safety lever. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: #) Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: #)
15650 : You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
15651 : It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
15652 : Train in this technique? Yes. No.
15653 : Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
15654 : ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
15655 : ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
15656 : ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
15657 : <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
15658 : ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
15659 : Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level #!
15660 : Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
15661 : Trade in your cinder? (Currently: # Pz) Not now. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. # gil: # Pz.
15662 : This is what you want, correct?
15663 : Make the exchange? Yes. No.
15664 : It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
15665 : Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
15666 : You transferred # Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. # Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
15667 : Ask about what? Nothing. Synergy furnaces. Synergy overview. Synergy procedure. Synergy recipes. Fewell replenishment. Materials for sale. Synergy techniques. Trading cinder.
15668 : The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
15669 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
15670 : Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
15671 : Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
15672 : You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
15673 : Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
15674 : This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call fewell. To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
15675 : As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
15676 : With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
15677 : The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
15678 : But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
15679 : If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
15680 : Take heart, though, as any materials inside your % will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
15681 : Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
15682 : Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
15683 : Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
15684 : You may be asking yourself, Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?
15685 : Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
15686 : The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
15687 : Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of %, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
15688 : Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that % may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
15689 : Mind you, % is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
15690 : Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
15691 : First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
15692 : You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
15693 : Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
15694 : You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
15695 : From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
15696 : Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
15697 : Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
15698 : However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
15699 : If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
15700 : You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
15701 : The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
15702 : It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
15703 : This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
15704 : As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
15705 : For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
15706 : You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
15707 : In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
15708 : Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
15709 : If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
15710 : Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
15711 : What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
15712 : The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
15713 : ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
15714 : Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
15715 : Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
15716 : Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
15717 : The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
15718 : In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as % can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
15719 : % cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of % can then be embedded.
15720 : The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
15721 : If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
15722 : As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
15723 : You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
15724 : Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
15725 : My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
15726 : The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
15727 : Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
15728 : To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
15729 : When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
15730 : Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
15731 : Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
15732 : As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call fewell. The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
15733 : Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
15734 : To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
15735 : For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
15736 : That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your %! What could be easier?
15737 : Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of %? If so, you've come to the right place!
15738 : We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
15739 : Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
15740 : Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
15741 : Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
15742 : My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
15743 : Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
15744 : Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
15745 : Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
15746 : The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
15747 : Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
15748 : Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
15749 : We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
15750 : It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
15751 : Wondering if your % can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
15752 : A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
15753 : Congratulations! Your % can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A %-shaped aperture, to be exact...
15754 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: # / [///////].
15755 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
15756 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
15757 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
15758 : That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
15759 : Hmm... I'm afraid your % cannot house any more apertures.
15760 : ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your % cannot be etched.
15761 : Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your % cannot be etched at this time.
15762 : Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

15766 : Oh, the %? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
15767 : Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
15768 : Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
15769 : Learn about synergy? Not today. Teach me! Just give me %.
15770 : A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
15771 : I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
15772 : Using % in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
15773 : What we call % serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
15774 : Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
15775 : Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your % into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
15776 : Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
15777 : Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
15778 : You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
15779 : But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
15780 : A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
15781 : That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
15782 : An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for %, you've certainly come to the right place.
15783 : I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for # gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
15784 : # gil, paid in full!
15785 : As promised, here's your %. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
15786 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
15787 : Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
15788 : Hail, soldier. I am a purveyor tasked with furnishing the brave men and women of the Voidwatch with essential supplies. My wares can be yours, provided you've got [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes] to trade.

15792 : It seems you're short on [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing credits/Allied Notes], soldier. Come back when you've got a bit more seasoning under your belt.
15793 : Make the trade? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Yes. No.
15794 : % obtains % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].

15807 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
15808 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
15809 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
15810 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
15811 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
15812 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
15813 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
15814 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
15815 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
15816 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
15817 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
15818 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
15819 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
15820 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
15821 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
15822 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
15823 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
15824 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
15825 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
15826 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
15827 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!

15844 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
15845 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
15846 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
15847 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.

15859 : A fair day to you, kind [sir/madam]! I am [Niscoliette/Prycillia/Chabobo], assistant to Atelloune. I suppose that makes me assistant to the assistant of his eminence, the great Professor Clavauert!
15860 : We have made a fascinating discovery--chocobos, just like humans, are capable of falling in love!
15861 : And you, my friend, come at the most fortuitous of times. How would you like to help me, erm...spur on the emotions of lovelorn chocobos?
15862 : Too hoo hoo, came to lend your aid once more? (More data for my thesis...splendid!)
15863 : Up for some chocobo matchmaking? I'm always up for a new experience! It'll only breed contempt.
15864 : Splendiferous! And just so we're clear, this is all for the benefit of the chocobos. I wouldn't even THINK of using you for my own research gains!
15865 : Is that so? I guess winning battles of the flesh doesn't mean you can win battles of the heart. Amateur.
15866 : If you change your mind, you know where to find me. (<Sigh> I'll have to actually do my own research for once.)
15867 : So, what's the first way into someone's heart? Presents! First, you'll need to search for and dig up a tantalizing gift!
15868 : You've only got # tries. Remember, the more gifts you give to chocobos, the more easily they swoon. Such simple creatures.
15869 : Select a [row/column]. (Attempt No. #) No. 1. No. 2. No. 3. No. 4. No. 5. Reselect row. Abandon this endeavor.
15870 : Truly let it wither on the vine? Love. Bah. No! We must cultivate!
15871 : How callous! All I wanted was to bring in dat...I mean bring darling chocobos together as soul mates!
15872 : Kweeeeeeeeeeeeh! (Wowow!)
15873 : Kw--Kweeeh!
15874 : The chocobo has unearthed %!
15875 : %! Way to show me how it's done! [/What a wonderful gift!/This'll make the best present ever!]
15876 : ...
15877 : You didn't find anything.
15878 : Why, it's like the locations of these presents change depending on the day! Hmm? Why do I know these things? Silly, I'm a scholar!
15879 : It's gotta be related to the day of the week. Call it women's intuition!
15880 : Oh, come on! Cupid's arrows are supposed to strike true, not go tumbling to the ground!
15881 : The chocobo whimpers in despair.
15882 : Maybe he'll perk up a bit later? Why don't you give it another go then?
15883 : You know what I do when I'm depressed? Eat some sweets. Maybe this poor fella just needs to eat something to cheer him up.
15884 : Now that we've got a present, it's time for step two!
15885 : Well, well, just what have you brought me? Oh, yes, this will do nicely. Our chocobo friend will be back up and kweh-ing in no time!
15886 : The chocobo has a special twinkle in his eye.
15887 : Next up: sweet nothings! Can't win the affections of the fairer sex without a silver tongue!
15888 : Though they may not be able to comprehend your words, the language of love is universal!
15889 : You've got a total of # chances. Think of it like speed dating! The glibber your jibe, the more they swoon!
15890 : The chocobo is completely smitten!
15891 : Absolutely perfect! You're no stranger to love, that's for sure!
15892 : What's this? No sweet nothings? Yes, yes, I know that true love needs no words, but when a romance is still budding, you've got to give it your all! Or...would you rather call it quits?
15893 : Most wondrous! Now that report of mine will be...<cough> Excuse me. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Quick, out with the magical phrase!
15894 : The chocobo blinks and cocks his head to one side.
15895 : Hmm... Maybe if you didn't beat around the bush? Try telling it like it is.
15896 : Maybe these baby chocobos can provide some kind of hint?
15897 : Now that you've found just the right words, it's time to take things to the next level!
15898 : According to my volumes of data, it seems [you two have a chilly relationship, but don't give up yet!/you're on the cusp of winning its heart./you two are on fire! You might as well get hitched!]
15899 : Speed! Luck! Come on, [hon/sweetie], love isn't a battlefield, it's a race!
15900 : Which route to pursue? Route 1. [(Taken by rival.)//] Route 2. [/(Taken by rival.)/] Route 3. [//(Taken by rival.)] Cast your fate to Lady Luck! Give up...at this late stage.
15901 : Route # has already been selected by your rival.
15902 : Let's get this party started!
15903 : Aw, you poor thing, looks like you chose the wrong path to love.
15904 : W-wow! What a turn of events! Love knows no bounds, as the saying goes! Just wait until the profess... I mean, uh, good going!
15905 : After all that hard work you did with your lovely present and those three magic words... Maybe love is all about luck and timing after all.
15906 : Well done! My little cupid has veritable wings sprouting from [his/her] back! The more love, the more data...dates! Dates they will go on!
15907 : With all you've done for me...err, the chocobos, it's only fair that I give you a little something in return. A token of my appreciation, if you will. Of course, you're welcome to come back any time!

15918 : You wish to exchange your sparks?
15919 : Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
15920 : Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
15921 : Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
15922 : Thanks to your donation, I now have # % in safekeeping.
15923 : Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
15924 : Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
15925 : Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
15926 : Why? What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
15927 : Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of # % from you.
15928 : You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
15929 : Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
15930 : Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
15931 : Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
15932 : ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
15933 : Grrreat! Now I have # % from you. Thanks!
15934 : Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
15935 : I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
15936 : Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
15937 : I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
15938 : Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of # % for you.

15942 : Completed objectives will vanish from your quest list unless they are repeatable. In the event that you wish to make room for different objectives, you will need to remove them manually.
15943 : As a corollary regarding rewards, you'll be blessed with special remuneration once you complete several objectives. Bask in the joy of these pleasant surprises when you can.
15944 : Lastly, any and all acts of vandalism directed against your % are strictly prohibited.

16043 : Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha? Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!
16044 : While I may tout its amazin'ness, don'tcha think fer even a second dat I's at liberty tah divulge hows we came by it. Still, I likes yer face. It's a kind face, one dat says ya won't stabs me in da back, which is more'n I can say fer my own mum. Lemme shows ya how to use dis myst'ry box.
16045 : Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm!  Ya open da chest. Dat's it. And da kicker be dat I'm da one doin' da openin'. Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?
16046 : Oh yeah, 'fore I forget. What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.
16047 : Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...
16048 : Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes. Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more. "Good things come tah dose who wait," right? Well, da longer ya wait, da gooder da thing...maybe. Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.
16049 : Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer daily tally. It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.
16050 : Finally, ya opens da chest. Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!
16051 : Oh, dat's right! Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase! Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?
16052 : And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy! But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.
16053 : Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it. Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.
16054 : Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble. It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.
16055 : Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in. Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.
16056 : Dat all make 'nough sense tah ya? Just say da woid when ya wanna use my services. I's more'n happy tah help.
16057 : Hey! I rem'mber seein' yer foice 'round here. Take a looksie. I's taken' it upon myself tah jigger 'round wit' dese all-new myst'ry boxes, found straight from an ol' capsized vessel in the Gugru Blue.
16058 : I's nevah gonna say how we gots our hands on 'em, so dun even ask! But, still, I gots tah say dat dese're somet'in' special! Now try yer hand 'fore I smack ya!
16059 : Just select yer desir'd dial and plug 'way at it. Will ya win somethin' super special? Or will't be da booby proize?
16060 : Dese're some special dials, an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!
16061 : Oh ho, I's forgettin' tah explain somethin' to ya. See dese special dials? Dey're super primo, but I still no know wut's gonna be in dere.
16062 : So I's not be takin' no responsibility if somethin' weird 'n wacky comes out. Got it? Ya open it, ya keep it.
16063 : 'N openin' 'em requires some kinda secret technique. Maybe it'll succeed, maybe tha box'll break. 'Sif I know. But ya can only try 'em once a day.
16064 : Oho, ya feelin' lucky 'nough tah takes a stab at da myst'ry box?
16065 : Whatcha gonna do? (# tally) Open the box and profit! Listen to the explanation. Inquire about my daily tally.  Peek at some possibilities. Nothing right now.
16066 : Ya wanna open dat sucker up? Okay, but which dial ya be wantin'?
16067 : Dat's da spirit! So which dial ya be wantin'?

16079 : Anywise, where'd da myst'ry be if ya's knew da answer 'fore ya opens it?
16080 : Some things is better left unknown. Gotta leave a little room fer romanchismo in da woild, y'know.
16081 : Dere we goes. Da myst'ry box seems tah like yer offerin'...but it wants more. Got anythin' else ya wanna throw away?
16082 : Dere we goes. Oho, looks like it don't wants no more. Guess ya gotta come back tomorrow if ya's wanna keep gettin' rid o' stuff.

16084 : Sorrah, but it won't lemme put dis in. Got anythin' it mights like better?
16085 : Sorrah, but da chest has dat look. Y'know, da one dat says, "I'll kills ya if ya tries tah give me dat." I guess alls ya can do is comes back some odda time.
16086 : Nah, it just won't woik. I's did my best, but yer daily tally just won't go no higher. Ya ain't gonna get no prizes by hoardin' yer points, so stop bein' such a Greedalox and use 'em.
16087 : Gil-lovin' Gobbies, %, ya's hit da jackpot! I's so happy for ya I think I's gettin' da vapors.

16103 : Oh, %! I'm so glad to see you!
16104 : You must be really special to be able to change forms like that! But I could tell who you were right away!
16105 : My friends and I are playing a fun game called sunshine seeker, where we search for shards of sunlight!
16106 : Just give them a little squeeze and you'll see how warm and bright they are!
16107 : But my friends're so much better than I am...
16108 : Maybe you could lend me a hand! Yours're much bigger than mine!
16109 : Lend Babban a hand? I'll lend you two! I'm a bit busy right now.
16110 : Aww... Hopefully you'll change your mind. I'll be waiting here!
16111 : Hooray! Maybe I'll finally be able to win!
16112 : I'll give you some small seeds in exchange for the shards of sunlight you bring back.
16113 : Even better! I've got some special things available for you to buy with your seeds!
16114 : But here's the best part--If you try your luck with my grab bag enough times, you might win something really super!
16115 : One of the rules of the game is that you must be a mandragora, like me, or else you won't be able to collect any shards.
16116 : They can be found all around here. But if you don't hurry, someone else might gobble them up.
16117 : But once you've taken them from one place, you can't get any more from there by searching it repeatedly!
16118 : Shards of sunlight are really delicate, so they'll disappear if you leave this area or take too much time getting them back to me.
16119 : My friends'll also try to get in your way, so be sure not to get noticed!
16120 : I can fly you right to the starting point. Just say the word!
16121 : Ready for mischief? The sun will bow before me! The light...it burns us!
16122 : Nononono, sunlight is your friend! Come back once you've decided to help me hunt!
16123 : Good luck! Collect as many as you can and bring them back to me!
16124 : Why, hello!
16125 : Inquire about what? I want to play the game. I'm ready to turn in my shards. I want to exchange small seeds. Let me try the grab bag. How many seeds do I have? I'd like the items you're holding for me. Dispose of what you're holding for me. Tell me how the game works. No questions for now.
16126 : You look like you'll be able to try for even harder things in this game!
16127 : My friends'll try to get in your way even more. Are you sure you're ready?
16128 : Wow! I'll bet you're ready for the championship round!
16129 : My friends'll surely never let you get away now! Sure you want to try anyway?
16130 : Oh no...you mean you didn't find even one single shard? That's terrible...
16131 : I'll be waiting for you to play our game again!
16132 : You did such a lovely job! You brought me # shard[/s] of sunlight, so I'll give you # small seed[/s]!
16133 : I can give you so many pretty gifts in exchange for your small seeds!
16134 : Which would you like?
16135 : Which would you like? (# seed[/s]). %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. %: # seed[/s]. None of these.

16138 : Which would you like to try?
16139 : Pick your poison. (# seed[/s]) The #-seed grab bag. The #-seed grab bag. The #-seed grab bag. No poison, thanks.
16140 : That grab bag contains prizes like %, %, and %.
16141 : Press your luck? C'mon, no whammies... Not right now.
16142 : You won %! Congratulations!
16143 : ...But your bags are full! What do you want me to do with it?
16144 : What will you do with the %? Have Babban hold it. I don't want it.

16157 : You feel a bit confused. Has someone taken... Hey! Where'd your shards go!? You only have # left!
16158 : What was that strange solar phenomenon? The number of shards of sunlight has increased, but Babban's friends are also moving faster than normal!
16159 : The sun returns to normal. There are fewer shards of sunlight available, but Babban's friends are also moving slower.
16160 : Time's up! Your quest for sunlight has ended in failure.
16161 : You've left the area, causing your quest for sunlight to end in failure.

16186 : Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.
16187 : Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.
16188 : Unity is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.
16189 : Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.
16190 : Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as %.
16191 : Chat settings may be changed by selecting Status from the main menu, and choosing Unity Info under the Unity submenu.
16192 : You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.
16193 : Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.
16194 : The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.
16195 : Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).
16196 : Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.
16197 : Wanted objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.
16198 : These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as Unity accolades to undertake.
16199 : Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.
16200 : Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.
16201 : The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.
16202 : A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.
16203 : Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.
16204 : Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.
16205 : When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.
16206 : Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.
16207 : No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.
16208 : You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.
16209 : An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.
16210 : One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.
16211 : A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.
16212 : You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.
16213 : Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.
16214 : Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.
16215 : Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.
16216 : The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.
16217 : It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.
16218 : The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.
16219 : Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.
16220 : These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.
16221 : Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.
16222 : Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of # accolades per week (Earth time).
16223 : You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.
16224 : This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.
16225 : This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.
16226 : However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.
16227 : Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.
16228 : The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.
16229 : Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.
16230 : Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.
16231 : On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.
16232 : Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by #. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.
16233 : The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.
16234 : Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.
16235 : Those with evaluations of # or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.
16236 : Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.
16237 : A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.
16238 : Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.
16239 : A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.
16240 : It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.
16241 : Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.
16242 : ou are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.
16243 : he A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.
16244 : ou call out for aid from the Unity leaders, but none have heeded your call. Please try again.
16245 : ou have already changed Unities. Please wait until the next tabulation period.
16246 : hould you choose to be teleported to this area, you will not have enough accolades to participate in the Wanted battle. Teleport anyway?
16247 : Teleport anyway? Yes, please. No, thank you.
16248 : The crystal resonates deep within your soul!
16249 : Vana'diel...in the year 898?
16250 : I must make haste for Reisenjima and find the master before...
16251 : Master, look at the orb.
16252 : You have set us on the proper course and passed through the first of many gates to come.
16253 : This precious jewel is one of Reisenjima Sanctorium's most mystical treasures.
16254 : Our legends state that it was formed from the energies of a thousand different lives.
16255 : Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.
16256 : In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.
16257 : Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.
16258 : Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.
16259 : Master, behold your orb.
16260 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.
16261 : But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...
16262 : And I am unable to remain here in 884.
16263 : My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.
16264 : Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...
16265 : But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.
16266 : May your steps remain swift and true.
16267 : Head for...the palace...
16268 : Master, behold your orb.
16269 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.
16270 : But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.
16271 : I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.
16272 : If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!
16273 : Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!
16274 : Master...forgive me.
16275 : Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.
16276 : I'm so hungry...
16277 : Ovjang...Ovjang, where are you?
16278 : I'm here...[in Aydeewa Subterrane/on a pirate ship]...
16279 : Luzaf...I wish you were here...
16280 : Please...help me...
16281 : Razfahd must be stopped...
16282 : Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...
16283 : I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.
16284 : I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.
16285 : Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.
16286 : The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.
16287 : Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?
16288 : Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?
16289 : Old gods? New?
16290 : No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.
16291 : We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.
16292 : And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.
16293 : There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.
16294 : Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.
16295 : And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.
16296 : Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.
16297 : But I am not a human such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.
16298 : For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.
16299 : Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.
16300 : Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.
16301 : It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.
16302 : I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.
16303 : All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...
16304 : An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.
16305 : I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.
16306 : Can you truly say that you [did/would have done] any different?
16307 : I channeled my love for my homeland into power.
16308 : When I fell before you...
16309 : ...did it mean everything was for naught?
16310 : I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.
16311 : And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.
16312 : This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.
16313 : Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.
16314 : Open your eyes and witness the truth!
16315 : Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!
16316 : %...
16317 : What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?
16318 : Is this a dream? What else could it be? No. It's something more...
16319 : Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.
16320 : A keen eye, as always.
16321 : The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.
16322 : As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.
16323 : I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.
16324 : And those...
16325 : ...Who you are destined to stop.
16326 : I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.
16327 : Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.
16328 : And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.
16329 : You don't really expect to save the world, do you?
16330 : At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.
16331 : Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.
16332 : So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.
16333 : One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.
16334 : Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.
16335 : False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers... The truth is the pain I feel inside.
16336 : Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.
16337 : Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.
16338 : Perhaps not even your precious-wecious hope.
16339 : Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.
16340 : No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...
16341 : ...no matter how much you want to give up...
16342 : You must not. You cannot.
16343 : Hope is something seized, not given.
16344 : Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...
16345 : There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.
16346 : You are the culmination of all your experiences.
16347 : Even those who are gone still depend on you.
16348 : %, this rhapsody is yours to sing.
16352 : Master--the orb.
16353 : You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.
16354 : Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.
16355 : He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.
16356 : I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?
16357 : What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.
16358 : We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.
16359 : Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.
16360 : And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...
16361 : The future should have changed...
16362 : ...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.
16363 : Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.
16364 : And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.
16365 : The time of the Harvest Festival is upon us once more, and with it comes a most wondrous event: a costume contest known as the Pink Masquerade!
16366 : Sick of donning those tattered old robes and half-rusted suits of armor? Then why not take this opportunity to dress up in something more festive--and perhaps even earn a prize for your efforts?
16367 : At the very least, the masquerade promises to be a refreshing change from your everyday adventures. What say you?
16368 : Participate in the Pink Masquerade? Sounds like fun! I think I'll pass.
16369 : A shame upon shames, to be sure. But there's still time to change your mind--the masquerade is available throughout the duration of the Harvest Festival!
16370 : Splendid! Let me explain the rules of our little competition.
16371 : All entrants are tasked with putting together the most lavish outfits they can find and strutting their stuff for the judge--namely, me. Points are awarded for the following types of equipment: main weapon, sub weapon, head, body, hands, legs, and feet.
16372 : We're an equal opportunity contest, so don't think you'll be impressing anyone here with your Gjallarhorns or Idrises! Only rewards gleaned from special events are counted.
16373 : Feel free to brandish them if you want, but don't expect me to care in the slightest.
16374 : As this is an event to celebrate the Harvest Festival, entrance fees will not be charged in the form of gil, but rather sweets.
16375 : Those whose outfits receive at least # points will be awarded with a commemorative piece of attire directly from the steering committee.
16376 : But why be content with being mediocre when you can reach for the stars? The top three contestants will have their entries displayed on these mannequins for all to see!
16377 : That's the long and short of it. Speak with me again if you have any further questions or would like to know what types of sweets we accept.
16378 : Until then, prepare your most outlandish costume and come back when you're ready to be judged!
16379 : Take this special garb as your just rewarded for coming up with such a delightful outfit!
16380 : Oh, heavens! Don't tell me you lost your %!
16381 : A distressing tale, indeed. I will furnish you with another one should you provide me with another piece of sweets.
16382 : As promised, here is another reward in exchange for your sweets. Make sure to keep this one safe and in pristine condition!
16383 : The pink masquerade is proving to be the event of the season, and I am both humbled and honored to serve as your guide.
16384 : Do you have any questions? Who are the winning entrants? Tell me about the costume contest. What kind of sweets do you want? Tell me how entrants are judged. I'd like %. None for now.
16385 : The costumes of the three entrants with the highest scores are displayed here for you to see. First place is in the center, second place is on the left, and third place is on the right. It is possible that multiple entrants have received the same score.
16386 : [/First/Second/Third] place: % - # pts.
16387 : No participants have received enough points to have their outfits displayed.
16388 : I will accept any of the following types of sweets as payment for participation in the masquerade.
16389 : Sweets list: (# types. Page # of #) Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. I'm done. Next page.
16390 : The judgment criteria is a bit nuanced, but I'll offer you the best explanation I can.
16391 : As the sole arbiter of fashion, the chief and chief alone issues garment-related edicts without any concern for race or gender.
16392 : Each accent you add to your costume affects the overall look, and he will determine a numerical value based upon the stuff you strut.
16393 : Yet I must warn you that he has trained hard under Brygid's watchful eye, and recognizes that the trends of the season are as fickle as the westerly winds.
16394 : In other words, just because you have received a particular score for wearing a given outfit, you are not guaranteed the same reception if you come back later donning the same garb.
16395 : And of course, the sweets you give me plays an integral... Ahem! Forget I said anything!
16396 : Another player's outfit is currently being critiqued. Please come back later.
16397 : Well, well, would you look at that stunning little number. Chief! You have a visitor!
16398 : Your score for this outfit is... #!
16399 : [Did your mother dress you in that?/Next time, put your socks on under your shoes!/I've seen worse...but not by much./Maybe if you had offered up some better sweets.../<Yawn> Been there, done that./The chief is wholly unimpressed./What an affront to common sensibility./At least you remembered to brush your teeth./The color scheme was a bit off...] Take your mistakes and learn from them for your next entry!
16400 : Congratulations! You have met the bar for success!
16401 : Here is your splendid gift, as promised!
16402 : I have given you all I have to give, but why not give it another go to see if you can place in the top three?
16403 : Why, this is one of the most splendid outfits we've seen! I am more than pleased to award you [/first/second/third] place!
16404 : Let me put that wonderful costume of yours up for display on one of our mannequins.
16405 : That's all I have for now. See if you can beat your own personal record next time!
16406 : As promised, here is your just reward for doing such a good job in this year's Pink Masquerade.
16407 : Though I've got nothing more to give you, I encourage you to participate again to see if you can beat your score!
16408 : (Shhh...mannequins aren't supposed to talk.)
16409 : (The pain of having to stand here perfectly still is indescribable...)
16410 : (At least I'll be able to line my stomach with sugary goodness once this is over.)
16411 : You must first turn the style lock function off before trading that item.
16412 : #%(Max:#)
16413 : #Woo-hoo factor.
16414 : (#/#/#(Max:#))
16415 : #Results.
16416 : Able adventurer, warmest welcome from the Magian Mooglehood.
16417 : To think you can perceive me in my true form, kupo! The trials of time take a toll on us all.
16418 : I command and control crystal-related incantations. Their ephemeral essence helps hold Vana'diel together.
16419 : Surely you have studied synthesis? Then you are doubtlessly versed in their myriad uses, kupo.
16420 : Promise you will not speak a syllable to others of my existence here.
16421 : Will you stay mum? Mum's the word. I don't think so.
16422 : ...
16423 : I scarce have the stamina to stop you, but I doubt others would believe this tale anyway.
16424 : Still, I shan't assist you if you don't promise.
16425 : Then the deed is done! In exchange, I shall proudly proffer my services in making your crystals ephemeral, too, kupo.
16426 : Ahhh, mayhap I have moved too quickly. Allow me to apprise you of the particulars--of this crystal storage, if you will.
16427 : It's strikingly simple. Trade me your crystals and I shall safely store them for you. You need only glance at your currencies list to see the amount I'm holding for you.
16428 : But I can store more than crystals alone. % and the like are also acceptable.
16429 : My mysterious moogle magic has limits, kupo, so I can only hold up to 5000 of a particular element.
16430 : You never know what secrets are in store unless you try!
16431 : You can wistfully withdraw them at any time by speaking to me.
16432 : Any number over 12 will be returned as clusters, kupo.
16433 : The  gives a sly smile.
16434 : This service is available to you free from the fetters of funding. As long as you keep this hush-hush, I'll always assist you with no recompense required.
16435 : If you can find me here, then you'll surely see me in other locations too, kupo. Moogle magic, you know.
16436 : Of course, I do not actually exist in Vana'diel. Only a part of me projects into your world.
16437 : It's rather similar to summoning magic, kupo.
16438 : I promise not to bore you with the particulars. Just come chat if you need me, kupo.
16439 : You are now able to store crystals!
16440 : Come for crystal-related concerns, hmm?
16441 : What would you like? Crystals returned to me. A bit of an explanation. Nothing for now.
16442 : Which element? Never mind. Fire  # Ice . # Wind . # Earth . # Lightning . # Water . # Light . # Darkness . #
16443 : How many would you like? None, actually. A specific number. As many you can fit.
16444 : How many? (# stored)
16445 : # [/fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/darkness] crystal[/s], correct? Then that will mean a total of...
16446 : # %.
16447 : # % and # ).
16448 : Are you sure?
16449 : Is this what you desire? Yes. No.
16450 : As many as you can fit!? I-if you say so...
16451 : Okay... Moogle Magic, ahoy!
16452 : There are limits to what my mysterious moogle magic can make up.
16453 : Inquire about what? Your purpose. Storing crystals. Retrieving crystals. Who are you? Nothing in particular.
16454 : I'm in charge of crystal chants. Crystals, of course, are the very lifeblood of Vana'diel, kupo.
16455 : Surely your sacks are spilling over with them! I can perhaps assist you with your problem.
16456 : You want me to hold onto these, kupo?
16457 : # %.
16458 : # % and # ).
16459 : Calculated in crystals, that comes to a total of # %.
16460 : Then let the magic begin!
16461 : That's all there is to it, kupo! Let me know if you need me again.
16462 : Unfortunately, it's all I can do to hold on to what you've already given me, kupo!
16463 : You have stored # % for a total of #.
16464 : You have stored # % and # ) for a total of #.
16465 : You want me to hold onto these, kupo? Then let the magic begin!
16466 : You have stored # % for a total of #.
16467 : You have stored # % and # ) for a total of #.
16468 : Here we sell items from the various guildmasters and also exchange crafter points for your convenience.
16469 : Sorry, we don't allow amateur craftsmen to take advantage of our services.
16470 : What would you like to do? Purchase a crafting kit. Exchange crafter points. . Special materials. Check the deliverable items. Ask about the delivery process. Never mind.
16471 : Please select a product. % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). Maybe some other time.

16473 : You want to purchase %? It will cost # gil for # of them.
16474 : Are you sure about this? Yes, I'm sure. On second thought...
16475 : I'm sorry, we don't currently seem to have the item available in that quantity.
16476 : Which item? (# crafter points) % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). I changed my mind.
16477 : Do you want to purchase the % for # crafter points?
16478 : Do you want to make the trade? Yes. No.
16479 : You don't have enough crafter points.
16480 : These are the items that we are taking deliveries of. Simply select an item whenever you want to check the recipe.
16481 : Deliverable Items %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. I'm finished here.
16482 : This is where you can deliver the crafting sets that the guildmasters have created.
16483 : By delivering items, you can earn crafter points that can be exchanged for special ingredients.
16484 : Crafting sets can be made by using special crystals known as analysis crystals, crystals which that enable you to set the quality level.
16485 : The higher the quality level of the crafting set created, the more crafter points you'll earn, so try to make the highest quality sets you can manage.
16486 : Analysis crystals can be obtained from the person in charge of accepting deliveries in exchange for guild points.
16487 : Analysis crystals cannot be used to create items other than the ones in the crafting sets.
16488 : Please note that you can't use % in place of %.
16489 : The ingredients required to make a crafting set can be checked by referring to the deliverable items list.
16490 : At the present time, you can receive up to a maximum of # guild point[/s].
16491 : Any points beyond that from making deliveries will be lost, so keep that in mind.
16492 : Crafting sets delivered here will be sold as crafting kits until the next day at 10:00 a.m. (Vana'diel time).
16493 : It helps the junior members of the guild, so keep on making those deliveries.
16494 : Thanks for the delivery. Everything looks to be in order.
16495 : You receive # crafter point[/s], and now have a total of # crafter point[/s]!
16496 : We now have available % for the low cost of # gil per.
16497 : I am willing to part with up to #.
16498 : My apologies, but our stock is limited and I cannot sell you any more at this time.
16499 : What do you want to do? Obtain a kit. Check the scheduled quantity. Ship the item. Nothing.
16500 : Which do you want? %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Exit.
16501 : What is the quality? (1-1000)
16502 : %: #
16503 : Oh, hello again. Hm? If I may inquire, what is that shield in your possession?
16504 : Ahh... I see you have met with her.
16505 : Of course, I heard the story about a special shield that can improve your crafting ability when equipped. Hahaha. I have no idea how it works though.
16506 : Although, if the theory behind it is sound and it actually works, I would be quite interested to know more about it.
16507 : I am well-versed in your abilities, and if she chose you for this task, then I suppose you just might have what it takes to make the shield.
16508 : Now then, we will first need to go over the recipe. It is important that you remember this, so listen carefully, take notes, do whatever it is you need to do.
16509 : So, the first ingredient you are going to need is %...
16510 : The function of this particular ingredient is to boost the Craftsmanship of the % to its full potential.
16511 : I actually have some information regarding Craftsmanship. I will read it out loud for you before you get started.
16512 : You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the % equipped.
16513 : Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.
16514 : In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.
16515 : You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...
16516 : Did you get all of that?
16517 : Once you have got the Craftsmanship rating up, come show me how you did. Then, I will be able to make you the %.
16518 : After that, you will need % and %, which you can get from Yek Falimeygo.
16519 : You have delivered various items to people before, right? That is basically what you will need to do to get those ingredients.
16520 : Go speak to Yek Falimeygo for more information.
16521 : That covers the ingredients you need. Be sure to show me the shield once you have upgraded it. I am very interested to see how it turns out.
16522 : Hm? You forgot the recipe already? Okay, here are the materials you need, but a craftsman of your caliber really should be able to remember these things.
16523 : You promised that we would always work together to improve our crafting skill. If anybody can do this, I am certain that it is you.
16524 : Impressive... I think you have successfully demonstrated the process. This should enable me to produce the %...
16525 : So, this is the %...
16526 : By pouring my heart and soul into the shield, I was able to form this crystal. Although the theory behind the process is quite straightforward, it still amazes me to see it in action.
16527 : Hmm... In crafting the %, it seems to have decreased the Craftsmanship of the %.
16528 : It is no problem to upgrade the %, but you will need to raise its Craftsmanship first if you wish to craft the % again.
16529 : Well, I know you are quite responsible and I am certain there is no way you could ever lose something so important.
16530 : What did you say? You somehow managed to lose the %? How is that even possible?
16531 : I even warned you about such a thing, too... Okay, give me the shield. I will craft another %.
16532 : You are a highly-skilled craftsman. As such, you need to make sure you take care of your ingredients.
16533 : It looks like you managed to make the upgrade. Let me see how you did.
16534 : Hmm... The shape has changed and I can feel a small amount of power emanating from it. Yet, it is still not enough to prove the theory.
16535 : I suppose it is just as she said it would be. Unless you craft with it multiple times, you will not get the results that you are expecting.
16536 : That reminds me, she wanted some kind of proof that the shield was done. Here, wait just a moment...
16537 : That should do it.
16538 : Just show the shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.
16539 : Lastly, please note that I always have deliveries to be made to Yek Falimeygo. I hope you will help train and educate the junior members of our guild.
16540 : Ah, it's good to see you. She's already told me about your next task.
16541 : Now, let's go over this new recipe, shall we? Pay attention, you're going to want to remember this.
16542 : There you go. Did you get all of that?
16543 : Next, let's go over how to obtain the ingredients, starting with the %.
16544 : First, you'll need to equip the % and craft with it until its Craftsmanship reaches 100%.
16545 : It's just the same as when we made the % before. However, you're going to need to make even more of an effort this time.
16546 : Bring me the shield once it's reached 100% and I'll make the % for you.
16547 : Next up is the %. Do you remember the % from last time? I've given both it and the % to Yek Falimeygo.
16548 : Next up is the %. I've partnered with the A.M.A.N. to create some Records of Eminence objectives for you.
16549 : You can check the Records of Eminence menu for more details. You'll receive the % once the objectives are complete.
16550 : That covers the ingredients. You know, it takes hard work and dedication to prove a theory like this is valid. That's why you're the perfect person for this job.
16551 : Hmm... It looks like you were successful.
16552 : I guess that means it's my turn. Here, I'll make the % for you now.
16553 : Okay, all finished.
16554 : Hmm... It looks like the shield's Craftsmanship has dropped again.
16555 : You need to take proper care of this thing so you don't need to come back to me again.
16556 : I must say, you never cease to amaze me. Well done.
16557 : You can really feel the difference compared to the previous shield. Its power is only going to increase as you unlock its potential.
16558 : Okay, let me mark the shield to prove the process is complete.
16559 : That should do it. Take the shield and show it to Mewk Chorosap.
16560 : I see you don't give up so easily. Very well. You may attempt the final objective once more.
16561 : Ahh... There you are. Shall we go over the next recipe, then?
16562 : Oh, you already know it? Forgive me.
16563 : Okay, you would like to know how to obtain the % and %? Very well. Listen carefully.
16564 : Our guild has received an order for a particular item, but I need you to fulfill the order for me.
16565 : However, this one's a bit of a strange request, you see... Although there are a few exceptions, you need to craft the item close to the customer that placed the order.
16566 : Apparently, they want to make sure you know what you're doing and also keep an eye on the quality of the finished product. They won't accept items crafted anywhere else, so be sure to keep that in mind.
16567 : You'll need to gather the materials necessary to make the requested item. I'll leave how you obtain them up to you.
16568 : It's still in the trial phase, but an agreement between the guilds has enabled you to purchase certain products that were previously unavailable.
16569 : You can purchase the products from the vendor responsible for selling crafting sets in each guild.
16570 : However, each guild has its own set of guidelines. You may not be able to purchase the item you need, but you might get lucky from time to time.
16571 : Once you've delivered the goods, I'll give you the % and %.
16572 : Did you get all that? This is the [first/next/final] request.
16573 : Deliver # % to Morunaude at the furniture shop in %
16574 : Deliver # % to Boizo-Naizo at the Manustery in %
16575 : Deliver # % to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in %
16576 : Deliver # % to Boizo-Naizo at the Manustery in %
16577 : This particular item does not need to be crafted near the customer.
16578 : Remember to report back to me after you've completed the request.
16579 : Let's see... Your current request is to...
16580 : How is the request coming along? I hope everything is proceeding apace.
16581 : Everything okay? Everything's great! It could be better...
16582 : Yes, I suppose I shouldn't worry so much. Let me know when you're finished.
16583 : Hmm... That's unfortunate, but I have faith in you. Just consider this to be a test of your abilities, and you'll see it through to the end.
16584 : Will you see this through? I'll do my best. I've had enough.
16585 : I see... Well, I guess I'll have to find somebody else to take care of this request, then.
16586 : You seem to be tired both mentally and physically. Try resting for a while and I'll give you another request when you're ready.
16587 : Well? Are you all rested up now? If so, let's get back to work.
16588 : Thank you for your report. You did a good job out there.
16589 : It looks like you've made the final delivery. I couldn't have done it better myself.
16590 : Now to give you the % and % as promised.
16591 : If you ever need these two items again, you can trade guild points for them.
16592 : I really have gotten quite good at this. Maybe someday, I can use these same principles to realize my dream of creating gold.
16593 : I see... So this is what the shield looks like this time around.
16594 : Hahaha! It really is a thing of beauty! It brings a smile to my face just looking at it.
16595 : According to her calculations, this next upgrade will unleash the shield's untold power. At last, the ultimate shield is within your grasp.
16596 : Oh, I almost forgot. I have a new crafting technique to teach you. You've already come so far, I'm sure you'll have no trouble using it.
16597 : Ah, there you are. If this procedure is done properly, this shield will possess extraordinary power.
16598 : Now then, let us discuss how to obtain the materials you will need.
16599 : I see you need % and %.
16600 : Of course, you will need to exchange crafter points like you normally do. If you have enough points, go visit Yek Falimeygo to exchange them.
16601 : Next, you will require %. The method for obtaining it is the same as before; hand me your shield once its Craftsmanship reaches 100%.
16602 : That concludes the explanation. The path that lies before you is clear. I look forward to seeing you reach its destination.
16603 : Now, you already know about the %, right? I believe Mewk Chorosap is looking for it, so take it to her.
16604 : Ah, it's you again. What can I help you with?
16605 : Hmm... You must be referring to the item that Tarutaru from Adoulin requested that I make.
16606 : I apologize, but you are too late. I have already sent it off to Jeuno.
16607 : I imagine it has been delivered to Mewk Chorosap by now. You will have to go and check for yourself.
16608 : Ah, you came at just the right time. Look here. The % that I sent to Jeuno was just sitting here on my desk.
16609 : It really is quite strange. Hm? You say you need this particular item? Very well. You are free to take it.
16610 : Hmm... Look at this emblem...
16611 : So this is what the completed shield looks like... I see the guild emblem I crafted is prominently displayed.
16612 : Hahahaha! If this is not perfection, I do not know what is!
16613 : This has been most entertaining. While this is not much of a reward, I would like to teach you a new crafting technique. I am certain you will have no problems mastering it.
16614 : I believe it will help open up the future of alchemy. However, my research on the matter is incomplete. I look forward to finding many breakthroughs in the field together!

16682 : Ugh. Leave it to Cornelia to bring up the tiniest little matter to those stuffy higher-ups.
16683 : Hume...Galka...we've all got different perspectives on things. She of all people should know that.
16684 : Different perspectives... Yeah, that makes sense. Not necessarily. What're you on about?
16685 : See? I knew an adventurer such as yourself would understand.
16686 : Is that so? I figured an adventurer such as yourself would understand.
16687 : Oops. I think I started in the middle of the story. Let's see...
16688 : Here's what happened. Cornelia thinks that Galka and Hume should engage in the same type of formal education.
16689 : She believes the best way to build bridges between our respective groups is to treat everyone equally from childhood.
16690 : It's a lofty goal, I'll admit, but though Galka have never been the type to go to schools as Humes do, we can still do all the things everyone else can. The three Rs, if you will.
16691 : When our long journey of rebirth ends, we learn everything we need to know from our elders.
16692 : And perhaps the biggest part of that is learning what it means to be a Galka.
16693 : Gumbah, I don't mean to say that there aren't things that young Galka can best learn from their own.
16694 : Cornelia. I assume you were listening in?
16695 : Just from the end. But in the same way, Galka can learn a lot from Humes, as well.
16696 : And schools are more than just places for our children to read from dusty old manuscripts and memorize their times tables.
16697 : They're places where children can interact with others--both their instructors and fellow students--and create the type of special bond that can only come from shared experiences.
16698 : Bonds, huh? You sure that it's not just a place for people to impress their beliefs on others?
16699 : No, that's not what I'm saying at all.
16700 : It sounds to me like Humes trying to impose their will on the Galka.
16701 : Gumbah, I'm not trying to do anything of the kind!
16702 : ...Sorry, Cornelia. I shouldn't have snapped at you. I've been having some terrible dreams lately, and my lack of good sleep might have caught up with me.
16703 : And besides, after everything that adventurers have done for our fair city, I wouldn't want to involve one in some petty squabbles. And surely you didn't come here to trade barbs, either.
16704 : Of course not. In fact...
16705 : I came with a request of sorts. One of the workers in the Zeruhn Mines came to me with the strangest sighting--a Galkan child wandering aimlessly about the place.
16706 : I can't help but think that the poor thing might have just been reborn and doesn't know where to go or what to do.
16707 : Of all the--the Zeruhn mines? We've got to go get some help from the adults!
16708 : I'm really worried. Maybe I'll trek on ahead.
16709 : Cornelia! Darn it, I don't think she heard me. I know her heart's in the right place, but those mines are dangerous!
16710 : I think we'd better split up. You go after Cornelia while I get some help.
16711 : The mines aren't exactly the best place for someone to wander around unprotected.
16712 : I'll head over as soon as I can. If what Cornelia heard is true, there's a chance you'll run into this Galka before her--so if you do, make sure he's safe, okay?
16713 : Hey, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer, would you mind going after Cornelia?
16714 : She's probably gone to the Zeruhn mines all on her lonesome.
16715 : I'll head over as soon as I can. If what she heard is true, there's a chance you'll run into the newly reborn Galka before Cornelia--so if you do, make sure he's safe, okay?
16716 : Ah, well look who it is. You must be concerned about the Galkan child too.
16717 : Of course. I should have known Gumbah would worry about me.
16718 : Between him and the foremen, everyone I've talked to today is too concerned for my well-being. They won't even let me further into the mines.
16719 : It doesn't make any sense. If they're that insistent on looking after me, then why wouldn't they be twice as interested in the young one wandering around unaccompanied?
16720 : When I pointed that out, Rasmus said, Oh, right. We did see him further in...
16721 : I know! They might not let me proceed, but surely they'd have no such qualms about you!
16722 : Maybe some of the other foremen would know more. Could you ask them about the Galkan child and go looking for him?
16723 : I'll be waiting for Gumbah to join up. Best of luck.
16724 : Cornelia is waiting for me in the Zeruhn Mines?
16725 : Then I guess I should go get my things together and head over to meet her. I promise to be quick.
16726 : What!? There actually was a Galkan child in Zeruhn!?
16727 : I'll get some Galkan adults and rush over there with them! You have to protect the child until we get there!
16728 : Thanks again, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer. Without you, who knows what that Goblin would have done to him--to Raebrimm.
16729 : He's been through a lot, and is resting here in the city. He was scuffed up a little, but we expect him to make a swift, safe recovery.
16730 : Still, don't you think it's a little out of character, even for a Goblin, to attack a child? What's that all about?
16731 : Ah, Cornelia! Were you able to learn anything?
16732 : I'm afraid I've turned up nothing.
16733 : I asked the Mythril Musketeers for help, and even though they gladly agreed to look into things, it might take a while before they find out anything concrete.
16734 : I guess it can't be helped, but it's still pretty frustrating. The Goblin might come after Raebrimm again, and we've got to be prepared.
16735 : I agree, and came up with a plan. What if we were to disguise Raebrimm?
16736 : Disguise him?
16737 : Yeah. You know, a little wig here, a little makeup there, and no one will be able to tell that it's him!
16738 : And if there's anyone who's an expert in making disguises to avoid attention, it's me.
16739 : Avoid attention? You? The guards have seen through your tricks so many times that I've started to keep a running tally.
16740 : Uh, well, be that as it may...
16741 : Failure is the first step to success, right? And I know just the fashionista to help us pull this off.
16742 : How do you know a fashionista!?
16743 : Why, everyone knows Brygid. And I think she owes me a favor.
16744 : You know how much she values her reputation. If anyone can help us disguise Raebrimm, it's her.
16745 : Why do I have a bad feeling about this?
16746 : I wouldn't say I have a bad feeling, but there is one small hurdle to climb. She says that she's looking for new entrants in a show that's going to start soon and doesn't have much time to spare for us.
16747 : And that's where you come in!
16748 : If you can help Brygid with her show, then she'll absolutely have to assist us! C'mon!
16749 : Cornelia! Corn-- Darn it, she ran off again. Leave it to her to just assume we'll follow this plan to the letter.
16750 : But I guess we don't have any choice now, do we? I know it's an odd request, but think of it as helping to protect an innocent child. Let's go find Brygid.
16751 : I know that Cornelia's plan may sound a bit half-baked, but I can't come up with anything better. Let's go find Brygid.
16752 : [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer, you remember our friend Raebrimm, right? The Galkan child in the unforgettable Goblin getup?
16753 : Do you remember Raebrimm? Of course. Who's that, again?
16754 : Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that your mind is sound.
16755 : How could you forget? After all, you were the one who went to the Zeruhn Mines and saved him from a vicious assault.
16756 : I've got some news on the black-clad Goblin that was threatening him.
16757 : Evidently we've been able to learn about where the menace was headed next.
16758 : Cornelia asked the Mythril Musketeers for their help in tracking the beastman down--and I'm pleased to report that they agreed to aid us.
16759 : Gumbah, I'm back!
16760 : Oh, and look who's with you!
16761 : %, your timing is impeccable, as always. I wanted to share this with the both of you.
16762 : Iron Eater, if you would.
16763 : <Sigh> How could I say no to that face?
16764 : We Mythril Musketeers have worked tirelessly to gather information on your little Goblin problem. While we haven't identified who exactly that little beastie is...
16765 : We do know that a strange Goblin was seen flitting about the markets, darting from shadow to shadow in an attempt to avoid detection.
16766 : I would imagine that a Goblin dressed in black from head to toe would arouse some amount of suspicion.
16767 : Aye, and surely we would have heard more reports if the beast moved via ordinary means...but his modes of transportation are a bit more arcane, which would explain why he is able to mostly avoid detection in his search for Raebrimm.
16768 : The good news is that Brygid's disguise seems to be working, because Raebrimm remains unharmed.
16769 : In fact, that's why we have any information at all--the Goblin must be getting desperate and resorting to more overt means of tracking his quarry, and just now we got word that someone matching his description was spotted in Korroloka Tunnel.
16770 : That's great news!
16771 : Is it really? I mean, we haven't exactly stopped his advance.
16772 : Fear not--we have no intention of letting him walk. In fact, I ordered Naji to go after him posthaste.
16773 : And by we, I mean the Mythril Musketeers. Miss Cornelia, you are to remain within the city walls.
16774 : You're going to let Naji take the lead AND make me stay here!?
16775 : No way. I've got to see this through to its conclusion.
16776 : While I share your distaste at letting Naji run point...
16777 : He is a Mythril Musketeer, unreliable though he may be.
16778 : Still, I agree that it couldn't hurt to send backup of some sort. Adventurer, I'd wager you're more than willing to volunteer.
16779 : What a splendid idea!
16780 : Most assuredly. We've got to let Raebrimm know that we will do anything to ensure his safety.
16781 : We're counting on you, %!
16782 : I know it's only Korroloka Tunnel, but Naji is definitely going to be in over his head.
16783 : Would you mind heading over? Not for my sake, but for Raebrimm's.
16784 : Raebrimm filled us in on what happened. You have my sincere thanks.
16785 : But Gloom Phantom, eh? What a straightforward moniker.
16786 : And the three of them call themselves The Destiny Destroyers. Well, at least their naming sense is on point.
16787 : I've known beastmen to be a bit odd, but an egg hunt? Something tells me they don't simply want initial eggs.
16788 : %! I heard that everything went well.
16789 : You're just the person I wanted to see, too. There's something I don't quite understand.
16790 : Cornelia? Did something happen?
16791 : Well, it's about Naji...
16792 : He hasn't returned to file his report, and it's well past time for him to make his way back the city.
16793 : Any info on Naji? He went after the three. He wasn't of much use. No clue.
16794 : The three? You mean the Goblin and friends?
16795 : While his desire to get to the heart of the matter is commendable, that doesn't change the fact that he left the Galkan child behind.
16796 : Nor did he send word back of his intentions.
16797 : I hope everything's okay. What if he was hurt? Or captured?
16798 : No, others have already reported seeing him back in the city with no apparent injuries.
16799 : Until he reports in, I suppose I'll have to ask you, Gumbah, to get the full story from Raebrimm.
16800 : Hmmm... Although I did order Naji to track down the source of the problem, he may have gotten in over his head.
16801 : But the most critical mission--ensuring Raebrimm's safety--appears to have been a rousing success. You have my thanks.
16802 : We couldn't have done it without you, %.
16803 : Gumbah, I'd like to hear what happened directly from Raebrimm's mouth. Perhaps we might glean some deeper insight into this matter.
16804 : Leave it to Naji to go traipsing off without backup.
16805 : According to Raebrimm, the Goblin succeeded in...whatever it was that they were trying to do.
16806 : As long as they'll leave him alone, though, does it really matter whether or not they're brought into custody?
16807 : That may very well be, but I'm afraid we're left with more questions than answers. I'd like to talk to Raebrimm myself.
16808 : Of course. I'll get him right away.
16809 : %, there's something that's been bothering me.
16810 : What exactly was the deal with that egg...or eggshell, I suppose?
16811 : Any idea? Egg...sandwich? Galkan rebirth...? No idea.
16812 : Huh? You think they had a case of the munchies?
16813 : If it was a whole egg, then I would understand, but wasn't it just an eggshell?
16814 : The journey of Galkan rebirth...
16815 : I wish I knew more about it, but Gumbah practically had my hide the last time I asked him about his own journey...
16816 : I suppose you'd rather not talk about it.
16817 : Maybe you think I'm just some girl in over my head, like everyone else...
16818 : Cornelia, the conclusion we came to is that the Goblin wasn't after the eggshell itself, but rather a whole egg.
16819 : They were trailing Raebrimm because they caught the scent of it, but what they found was just a shell of what they thought it would be.
16820 : That's the lamest pun I've ever heard.
16821 : I couldn't resist. Perhaps that mystery will have to wait for later, and we'll have to content ourselves with Raebrimm's freedom.
16822 : You're right.
16823 : %, we'll let you know if we hear anything else.
16824 : As will the Mythril Musketeers. Naji's heart is in the right place.
16825 : I'd like to give you something other than just platitudes for your efforts.
16826 : Me too. It's a special recipe favored by my extended family.
16827 : Until next time!
16828 : Your help was critical in ensuring Raebrimm's safety. Here's a little something from me and Cornelia.
16829 : This is an explanation of the Assist Channel feature, which allows new and returning players to seek help from veteran adventurers.

16885 : In the interest of fairness, I am unable to distribute multiple linkpearls to someone on the same day. Please come back tomorrow.
16886 : It is my sincere pleasure to bestow this upon you.
16887 : Your new linkshell is beyond doubt filled with many looking for new companions. Be sure to say a few words of greeting.
16888 : I have prepared a small manual describing the importance of treating others with respect. Please have a quick glance at it when you have a moment.
16889 : May your new linkshell provide you with fond memories that will last a lifetime.
16890 : Though it pains me to say this, I have no % that meet your requirements at this time.

Date posted: //. Receive %
16939 : I can start looking for new members immediately. Is this information correct?
16940 : What will you do? Start looking for members. Stop the process.
16941 : Your registration is officially complete.
16942 : May your journeys lead you to many as-yet-unmet friends, and may the bonds you forge last a lifetime.
16943 : Another member of that linkshell currently has an active registration. Please wait until that registration expires and try again.
16944 : A manual describing proper chat manners floats in front of you.
16945 : Read up on which topic? None for now. I don't know what to talk about. How can I get people to like me? What shouldn't I do? What happens if we don't mesh?
16946 : Perhaps consider starting with a simple greeting. Something like...
16947 : Hello, everyone. My name's %. Nice to meet you!
16948 : Of course, injecting your own personal flavor may act as a conversation starter and help people to remember you.
16949 : No matter which route you choose, make sure to always remain polite. There is no better way to start a friendship off on the right foot.
16950 : When speaking with others, it's critical to listen and be mindful of what they say.
16951 : Always talking and never listening may come across as rude.
16952 : Another important point is to always be mindful of the listener. How would you feel if someone said that to you? Think carefully before sending someone a message.
16953 : It also helps to be clear and concise.
16954 : Being vague might cause others to get the wrong impression.
16955 : Be extremely careful when giving out personal information such as your address or telephone number.
16956 : Furthermore, refrain from making disparaging or aggressive remarks.
16957 : Once you are close to someone, you may be more comfortable letting your hair down, but it is strongly recommended that you refrain from any actions that may be construed as harassment.
16958 : After joining a linkshell, you may find that you have difficulty participating in conversation or that your personality is too different from the other members.
16959 : One of your options in such a situation is to inform the linkshell leader and then leave.
16960 : Finding a linkshell that is the perfect fit might not always be easy, but there is certainly a group out there that will match your feelings and goals.
16961 : Once you find those kinds of friends, hold them fast and value them as much as they value you. There is no better way to enjoy life in Vana'diel.
16962 : The linkshell concierge opens up a tiny notebook...
16964 : Hey, [miss/mister], excellent timing.
16965 : Raebrimm is looking for you. I think he wants to talk to you about something.
16966 : He probably has grown tired of Bastok and wants to ask you about life outside these walls.
16967 : Although, don't take him outside the city, no matter how much he begs you. I'm still worried about him...
16968 : Sometimes, he gets this blank look on his face and says he's forgetting something important.
16969 : So that's why I'm always trying to keep an eye on him.
16970 : Although, whenever I do, I often feel waves of nostalgia crashing over me too.
16971 : Hmm... Maybe Raebrimm is actually somebody I knew before that has undergone some kind of rebirth...
16972 : Oh, where was I? Ah, yes... If you're going to see Raebrimm, you should probably hurry.
16973 : You should be able to catch up with him at the entrance to the Zeruhn Mines just west of here.
16974 : Apparently, he was sent on an errand, so he said he needed to visit Drangord.
16975 : Hey, [miss/mister]. I think Raebrimm wants to talk to you. You should go see him.
16976 : I guess he's on some kind of errand, so he said he was going to visit Drangord.
16977 : You might be able to find him at the entrance to the Zeruhn Mines just west of here.
16978 : Hm? You say you're a friend of Raebrimm's?
16979 : I actually just sent him on another errand.
16980 : He may be just a kid, but he's quite dependable. Although, I probably shouldn't ask so much of him...
16981 : Come with me. I'll go get him for ya.
16982 : Ah, %!
16983 : Wait till you hear this! I actually remembered something!
16984 : It just came to me after staring at that large mountain every day!
16985 : That eggshell I gave to that Gloom Phantom guy in the Korroloka Tunnel...
16986 : I remember that it also came from a large mountain.
16987 : I was surrounded by the sparkle of twilight...
16988 : I kept climbing the mountain path as it rose higher and higher...
16989 : And once I reached the summit, I saw somebody there!
16990 : What do you inquire? What mountain? Who did you see? When was this?
16991 : Um... I don't know...
16992 : Well, I... I don't remember...
16993 : Sorry, it's still a bit fuzzy...
16994 : I just thought it was important to tell somebody about this right away.
16995 : I thought you might know what it meant, %.
16996 : Is that you, Raebrimm? And % too!?
16997 : Cornelia!? Why are you so out of breath!?
16998 : We've got trouble! Some terrifying monsters have appeared within the Zeruhn Mines!
16999 : What!?
17000 : You must help us, %! We have to help the people still trapped in the mines!
17001 : Please be careful, %...
17002 : What's all the commotion!? Did something happen?
17003 : At times like this, it's important to remain calm. That allows us to protect what's important.
17004 : Hm? You saw Cornelia, and there's trouble in the Zeruhn Mines?
17005 : I'm sure the Mythril Musketeers will show up any moment now, so there's nothing to worry about. Although, I suppose it's too early to let down our guard.
17006 : Can you hurry over to the mines, [miss/mister]? Those people need your help!
17007 : Cornelia told me everything. I'm just glad you're okay, [miss/mister].
17008 : This sudden attack by the Quadav... What will become of Bastok, and of us?
