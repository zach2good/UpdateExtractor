6605 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6606 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6607 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6608 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6609 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6610 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6611 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6612 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6617 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6618 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6619 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6620 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6621 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6622 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6623 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6624 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6625 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6626 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6627 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6628 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6629 : A parting gift!
6630 : Ha!

6646 : We can start fighting any time.
6647 : I'm prepared for battle.

6654 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6655 : I'm prepared for battle.
6656 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6659 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6660 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6661 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6662 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6663 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6664 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6665 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6666 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6667 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6668 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6669 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6670 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6676 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6677 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6678 : I'm fine...really.
6679 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6680 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6681 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6682 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6683 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6684 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6693 : I need to take a break soon.
6694 : Hey, how about taking five?
6695 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6696 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6697 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6698 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6699 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6708 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6709 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6710 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6711 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6712 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6713 : Please... I need to sit down...

6799 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6800 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6801 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
6802 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!

6827 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6828 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6829 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6830 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6831 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6832 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6833 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6834 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6835 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6836 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6837 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6838 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6839 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6840 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6841 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6842 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6843 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6844 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6845 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6846 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6847 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6848 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6849 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6850 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6851 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6852 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6853 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6854 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6855 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6856 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6857 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6858 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6859 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6860 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6861 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6862 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6863 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6864 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6865 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6866 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6867 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6868 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6869 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6870 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6871 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6872 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6873 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6874 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6875 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6876 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6877 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6878 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6879 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6880 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7392 : Here's what we want you to do: defeat the creatures that are infesting the scrap materials, then take the evidence of their destruction to Raifa.
7393 : We have prepared an ointment to rub on your skin that will lure the creatures out of hiding.
7394 : They've left track marks all over the place, especially around H-6.

7403 : Hmmm?
7404 : What do you desire? Nothing. To have the ointment removed. To reconfirm where I'm going.
7405 : This looks like a pile of scrap materials.
7406 : The ointment's odor draws out the monsters!

7477 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
7478 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
7479 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
7480 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
7481 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
7482 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
7483 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
7484 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
7485 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
7486 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
7487 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
7488 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
7489 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
7490 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
7491 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
7492 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
7493 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
7494 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
7495 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
7496 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
7497 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
7498 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
7499 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
7500 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
7501 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
7502 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
7503 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
7504 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
7505 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
7506 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
7507 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
7508 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
7509 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
7510 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
7511 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
7512 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
7513 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
7514 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
7515 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
7516 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
7517 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
7518 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
7519 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
7520 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%

11465 : Apropos of nothing, I'd like to add that I also learned the ways of the blacksmith in order to forge swords worthy of the strength I have attained.
